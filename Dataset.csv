1,1,"This Consumer Credit Card Agreement and Disclosure together with the Account Opening Disclosure and any other Account opening documents or any subsequent documents provided to You related to this Account (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Agreement”) govern the terms and conditions of this Account. “We,” “Us,” “Our” and “Ours” and “Credit Union” refers to 1st Advantage Federal Credit Union with which this Agreement is made. “You,” “Your,” and “Yours” refers to each applicant and co-applicant for the Account; any person responsible for paying the Account; and anyone You authorize to use, access or service the Account. ""Card"" means the Mastercard® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
1,2,SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase.
1,3,"If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
1,4,"You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower."
1,5,"Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
1,6,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions"
1,7,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law"
1,8,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. © CUNA Mutual Group 1991, 2006, 09, 10, 12, 14, 16 All Rights Reserved 04501990-MXC30-P-1-031519 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
1,9,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement"
1,10,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
1,11,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement"
1,12,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Mastercard from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Mastercard itself receives or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that You complete or a merchant completes on Your Card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement"
1,13,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
1,14,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
1,15,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges Page 2 of 5 04501990-MXC30-P-1-031519 (MXC303-E) 9/2019 are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
1,16,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default under this Agreement if You fail to pay the Minimum Payment Due by its Payment Due Date; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored or that We must return because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit that is returned unpaid; make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; file for bankruptcy; or die. You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement You have with Us. If You default, We may close Your Account and require You to pay any unpaid balance immediately, subject to applicable law. In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account."
1,17,"11. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at the address listed on Your bill or call Us toll-free at 800-449-7728 or 855-584-2958, seven days a week and weekends 24 hours a day.

If You request that We issue a card or any Account Access Device to another person, You are responsible for all charges incurred by such person until You return their card to Us, or until You notify Us that use of their card or any Account Access Device is no longer authorized, whichever occurs first. We may, in Our discretion and to the extent permitted by law, restrict or refuse any request that We issue a card or any Account Access Device to another party. If unauthorized use of Your Account occurs, You agree to cooperate with law enforcement and Us in identifying the unauthorized user. As permitted by law, We may consider charges made by someone known to You (i.e. family member, relative, significant other, partner, roommate, co-worker, friend) using Your card or any Account Access Device as authorized by You. Each person named on the application for the Account and anyone else authorized to use the Account in any way is jointly and severally liable for all amounts due on this Account."
3,7,"CREDIT LIMIT/AUTHORIZATIONS: Your “Credit Limit” is the maximum amount of credit available under Your Account at any time. We will notify You of Your Credit Limit with Your Account Documents and on Your Billing Statements, and We may change or restrict Your credit availability at any time. You agree not to exceed the established Credit Limit and to pay any amount in excess of Your Credit Limit immediately. We are not obligated to allow the balance of Your Account to exceed its Credit Limit. If Your Account is a joint Account, each of You may request Credit Limit increases subject to applicable law. We may raise or lower Your Credit Limit at Our discretion and may restrict the amount of the Credit Limit available for Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. You may not use Your Account for (and We may decline authorization for) any illegal transaction. We may decline authorization for any Internet gambling transaction. We may, in Our discretion and to the extent permitted by law, restrict or delay the availability of credit to You for risk management purposes, and to protect You and Us against actual or potential fraud, unauthorized transactions, or claims. We are not liable for declining authorization for any particular transaction, regardless of reason."
3,8,"3. PAYMENTS PROMISE TO PAY: You promise to pay all amounts due on Your Account. You agree to review Your Billing Statements and to notify Us promptly of any errors (see “Your Billing Rights” below). You may pay all or part of the balance on Your Account at any time. However, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment shown on Your Billing Statement by the due date each month. You agree to follow the requirements for payments that We set forth on Your Billing Statement, including requirements that payments be made in U.S. dollars and checks be drawn on a U.S. bank. If We choose to accept a payment that is not in U.S. dollars or not drawn on a U.S. bank, You agree to pay any collection or conversion fees assessed to Us by third parties. We may accept payments which are marked “payment in full” or with similar markings without losing Our right to receive payment of all amounts due on Your Account. Partial payments offered in full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be sent to the address for notice of billing errors shown on Your Billing Statement. We reserve Our rights as to all such payments."
3,9,"MINIMUM PAYMENT CALCULATION: The “Minimum Payment” is the minimum dollar amount that is shown on Your Billing Statements that must be paid before the due date that is specified in Your Billing Statement each month. The Minimum Payment shall be: (A) Your total new balance if it is less than or equal to $25; or (B) The greater of (a) $25, or (b) the billed Interest Charges and billed late fees, if any, plus 1% of the total new balance. If Your Account balance exceeds Your Credit Limit, We will add to the Minimum Payment the amount necessary to reduce Your balance to Your approved Credit Limit. If Your Account is past due, We will also add any amount that is past due on Your Account"
3,10,"APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: We may apply Your Minimum Payment to Balance Categories in the order We choose. We apply payment amounts above the Minimum Payment to the Balance Category with the highest Annual Percentage Rates, in descending order. Until We determine a payment is unlikely to be returned, Your available credit may not reflect the payment."
3,11,"APPLICATION OF CREDITS: We will apply credits, such as a merchant’s refund for goods or services purchased on Your Account, to Your Account as required by law. In some cases, credits may not be posted to Your Account until a Billing Cycle subsequent to the date of the credit transaction."
3,12,"4. INTEREST CHARGES & FEES FIXED RATE INFORMATION: If any Annual Percentage Rate is expressly labeled or described as “fixed” on Your Account, that fixed rate will not change for any reason during (i) its specified duration; or (ii) the life of the applicable balance or Account if either no duration is specified or the duration is indefinite. If any Annual Percentage Rate is not expressly labeled or described as “fixed,” it is variable."
3,13,"VARIABLE RATE INFORMATION: If any Annual Percentage Rate is variable, Your rate is determined by adding the applicable margin to the applicable Index, as described in the Disclosure. The daily periodic rate is 1/365th (1/366th during leap years) of the Annual Percentage Rate."
3,14,"INCREASED AND/OR PENALTY RATES: If We do not receive Your required Minimum Payment by its due date, You exceed Your Credit Limit, or You make a payment to Us that is dishonored or returned for any reason, We may increase any or all of Your Annual Percentage Rates on future transactions (including, but not limited to Special Offer Rates). We also may increase the Annual Percentage Rates on all Your balances and transactions, including those incurred prior to the notice of increase, if We do not receive Your required Minimum Payment within 60 days after its due date. If We increase Your rates, We may determine the amount of the increase based on historical information regarding Your Account and Your credit in general. We will give You a notice of the increase. The highest rate that may apply will be the “Penalty Rate” (or “Penalty APR”) shown on the Disclosure, subject to applicable law. However, increased rates will cease to apply if We receive six consecutive monthly Minimum Payments on or before their payment due dates, beginning with the first payment due date following the effective date of the increase. When a Penalty Rate ceases to apply, the interest rate in effect before the increase will again apply as disclosed."
3,15,"ACCRUAL OF INTEREST CHARGES: We will accrue Periodic Rate Interest Charges on each of the Balance Categories from the date of each transaction or the first day of the Billing Cycle in which the transaction is added to Your Account, whichever is later"
3,16,"GRACE PERIOD: We will not charge You any interest on Purchases if You pay Your entire balance by the due date each month; this is called the “Grace Period.” Payment in full is generally required to obtain the benefit of the Grace Period. However, We will give You the benefit of the Grace Period for partial payments to the extent required by law. The Grace Period applies only to Purchases and, if applicable, Special Offers. The Grace Period does not apply to Balance Transfers or Cash Advances."
3,17,"PERIODIC RATE INTEREST CHARGES: “Periodic Rate Interest Charges” are charges to Your Account based on the application of Annual Percentage Rates, and will be calculated using daily periodic rates which correspond to applicable Annual Percentage Rates. These rates may vary by Balance Category. (A) If Your Account was opened with an Introductory Rate(s), the rate(s) for Your Account will be at the Introductory Rate(s) shown on the Disclosure and will continue in effect as shown on the Disclosure. (B) After the Introductory Rate(s) expire or if Your Account does not have an Introductory Rate, the Annual Percentage Rate(s) for Your Account will be the rate(s) shown on the Disclosure. (C) The Annual Percentage Rate(s) applicable to any Special Offers and circumstances under which it will apply will be provided to You when We make the offer"
3,18,"INTEREST CHARGES AND BALANCE CALCULATIONS: We use the Average Daily Balance (including new Purchases) method to compute a portion of the interest charges on Your Account. We calculate Periodic Rate Interest Charges separately for each Balance Category. (A) To compute billed Periodic Rate Interest Charges: (1) For each Balance Category, We multiply Your “Daily Balance” (see below) by the applicable daily periodic rate for each day of the Billing Cycle; then (2) We add together all of the amounts calculated in (1) above. (B) To compute the “Daily Balance” for each Balance Category: (1) We take the beginning balance of the Balance Category each day; (2) Add any new transactions (such as purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and debit adjustments, as applicable) and any new fees applicable to that Balance Category; and (3) Subtract any payments, credits, credit adjustments, non-accruing fees and unpaid interest charges applicable to that Balance Category."
3,19,"We treat a credit balance as a balance of zero. Also, for purposes of these computations, We may delay adding some fees to Your Daily Balance for each Balance Category (for example, some fees may not be added to Your Daily Balance until the Billing Cycle after they are imposed). We may also subtract some payments or portions of some payments from Your Daily Balance of each Balance Category earlier than when they were actually received (for example, for Grace Period purposes, portions of some payments received in one Billing Cycle may be considered applied to Your Purchase Balance Category or Special Offer Balance Category, as applicable, at the end of the prior Billing Cycle). We add the amount calculated in accordance with (A)(1) above to the Daily Balance for each Balance Category and this amount becomes the beginning balance for that Balance Category for the next day. On Your Billing Statement, We will calculate an “Average Daily Balance” for each Balance Category by adding all Your Daily Balances for that Balance Category and dividing that amount by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. If You multiply the Average Daily Balance for a Balance Category by its daily periodic rate and multiply the result by the number of days in the Billing Cycle, the total will equal the billed Periodic Rate Interest Charges for that Balance Category, except for minor variations due to rounding. Billed Periodic Rate Interest Charges will appear on Your Billing Statement labeled as “Interest Charge” for each Balance Category. The Interest Charges for each Balance Category will be totaled on Your Billing Statement and listed as the “Total Interest.” This Agreement provides for daily compounding of interest charges and fees."
3,20,"BALANCE TRANSFERS AND BALANCE TRANSFER FEES: We may permit You to transfer balances from other credit card companies or financial institutions (“Other Accounts”) to Your Account. All Balance Transfer requests are subject to Our approval; We are not liable if We do not accept a requested Balance Transfer. We reserve the right to process Balance Transfers in the order We select and to limit the amount of any Balance Transfers that We may process (this amount may be less than Your Credit Limit). If You request an amount that We do not approve, We may process a partial transfer for less than You requested or We may decline the entire request. You may not transfer any balance You owe from any other MidFirst account or any of Your accounts with any of Our related companies. You should not transfer any amount that is in dispute in order to preserve Your dispute rights. You should continue to monitor the Other Accounts from which You have requested a balance be transferred to Your Account and You should continue to pay the minimum payments due on the Other Accounts until You receive confirmation from those creditors showing that the balances due on the Other Accounts have been paid in full. This may not happen until after the Balance Transfer appears on Your Billing Statement from Us. We are not liable for any late payments, interest or finance charges or disputed amounts on Your Other Accounts. If You want Your Other Accounts closed following a Balance Transfer, You are responsible for doing so. We will charge You a Balance Transfer Fee for each Balance Transfer as shown on the Disclosure. Balance Transfer Fees will be added to Your Balance Transfers Balance Category."
3,21,CASH ADVANCE FEES: A Cash Advance Fee will be imposed for each Cash Advance transaction as shown on the Disclosure and added to Your Cash Advances Balance Category.
3,22,"CASH EQUIVALENT TRANSACTION FEES: A Cash Advance Fee will be charged for each Cash Equivalent Transaction as indicated on the Disclosure. “Cash Equivalent Transactions” are those transactions performed using a merchant or service provider that Visa® or MasterCard® identifies as a seller of traveler’s checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, lottery tickets, funds used for wagers or gambling, or similar products or services. These transactions are also treated as Cash Advances for all other purposes on Your Account, including the Annual Percentage Rate that applies to the Account. Cash Advance Fees will be added to Your Cash Advances Balance Category."
3,23,FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEES: A Foreign Transaction Fee may be assessed on all transactions made a.) in currencies other than U.S. dollars; (b.) with a foreign merchant; or (c.) outside the United States. The foreign transaction fee will be equal to a certain percentage of the amount of each foreign transaction (after conversion to U.S. dollars) as shown on the Disclosure. These fees will be added to the Balance Category that We select.
3,24,"ANNUAL FEE: : If Your Account has an annual fee, it is shown on the accompanying Disclosure and will be charged to Your Account as a Purchase."
3,25,"OTHER FEES: We may charge additional fees from time to time. The amount charged for these fees is shown in the Disclosure unless otherwise indicated. Each of the below fees will be added to the Balance Category that We select. Late Payment Fee. For each Minimum Payment which is not received by the payment due date or is dishonored for any reason, We may charge You a late fee as disclosed on the accompanying Disclosure according to the amount of Your new balance. Returned Payment Fee. Subject to applicable law, a returned payment fee may be assessed as indicated on the Disclosure for any payment (including any ACH or electronic payments) on Your Account which is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason (including any payment returned because it is not signed, authorized or cannot be processed for any reason). Stop Payment Fee. A stop payment fee may be assessed as indicated on the Disclosure for any stop payment You request Us to make with respect to checks that access Your Account, including Cash Advance checks or Balance Transfer checks. Copy Fees and Additional/Replacement Card Fees. We may charge You a fee for (i) each sales draft copy You request (unless the request is related to a billing error); (ii) each additional or replacement card requested; and (iii) for each copy of a Billing Statement that You request. These fees are not listed on the Disclosure but will be disclosed to You upon Your request of such copies and/or additional or replacement cards. Customized Card Design Fee. We may charge You a fee for having Us complete a customized card design that You request. This fee is not listed on the Disclosure but will be disclosed to You upon Your request of such customized card design. Expedited Card Fees. We may charge You a fee for an expedited delivery of additional or replacement cards. This fee is not listed on the Disclosure but will be disclosed to You upon Your request of such expedited delivery. Expedited Payment Fee. Subject to applicable law, We may charge You a fee for making an expedited payment that requires assistance from one of Our customer service representatives. This fee is not listed on the Disclosure but will be disclosed to You upon Your request of such expedited payment assistance. ATM Surcharge. For all ATM transactions, a surcharge may be imposed by the ATM operator. This surcharge is imposed by third parties and will be charged to Your Account"
3,26,"TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Transactions made in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars under the current regulations of Visa®, MasterCard® or the Visa®/PLUS® ATM Network. Those regulations currently provide that the conversion rate may be either (a.) a wholesale market rate or (b.) a government-mandated rate. Visa® and MasterCard® currently use the rate in effect on the date they process Your transaction. The currency conversion rate in effect on the date Your transaction is processed may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date. The Visa®/ PLUS® ATM Network currently uses the rate in effect on the transaction date."
3,27,"5. CLOSURE OR IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF YOUR ACCOUNT REASONS FOR REQUIRING IMMEDIATE PAYMENT: Subject to applicable law and any right to cure that You may have under that law, We may require immediate payment of Your entire Account balance if: 1.

Further, if any of the above-referenced events occurs, We may take the following actions with or without notice to You (in accordance with applicable law): close or suspend Your Account, lower the Account Credit Limit, increase Your Minimum Payment, pursue any other lawful action against You, including the filing of a lawsuit against You. Our acceptance of a payment after one or more of the above-listed events does not waive Our right to pursue any other lawful remedies to which We are entitled under law."
3,28,"COLLECTION COSTS: You agree to pay all of Our reasonable costs incurred in pursuing collection of the amount You owe, including attorneys’ fees."
3,29,"TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF CREDIT PRIVILEGES: We may at any time, with or without cause and without advance notice, terminate this Agreement and/or temporarily or permanently suspend Your credit privileges. Your obligations under this Agreement continue after Your rights to obtain credit have been terminated or suspended."
3,30,"6. CHANGES IN TERMS AND OUR RIGHTS IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CHANGES IN TERMS: Subject to applicable law, We may unilaterally change the Annual Percentage Rates, fees and other terms of this Agreement at any time, including after Your Account is closed (regardless of the reason You or We closed the Account). This includes modifications, deletions of existing terms, and the addition of new provisions, including nonfinancial provisions (for example, We may add provisions relating to Our enforcement rights or the resolution of claims and disputes). If We make changes, We will send You all notices required by law. Unless We explain otherwise in a change in terms notice You receive, the following rules will apply: (1) changes will be automatically effective on the date We specify and without the necessity of any further assent on Your part; and (2) use of Your Account is not necessary for a change in terms to be effective."
3,31,"OUR RIGHTS: Our failure to exercise, or Our delay in exercising, any of Our rights under the Agreement for any reason will not mean We are unable to exercise those rights later. We may, from time to time on a consistent or inconsistent basis, take (or refrain from taking) certain actions that benefit You but that are not required by this Agreement or applicable law. Any such course of dealing or course of performance on Our part shall not be considered as an additional legal obligation to You under this Agreement. We may discontinue any such course of dealing or course of performance at any time without prior written notice."
3,32,"7. USING YOUR ACCOUNT THROUGH CHECKS AND SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS CHECKS THAT ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT: Any checks or similar instruments (including electronic form or otherwise) that We provide to You or issue on Your behalf will be treated as Cash Advances, unless We indicate otherwise. Checks or similar instruments (including electronic form or otherwise) that We provide to You may not be used to make payments on any account You have with Us. To stop payment on a check or similar instrument (including electronic form or otherwise), You must notify Us of the number and amount of the check or similar instrument before We receive it; We need not stop payment on checks or similar instruments that We issue on Your behalf. We may pay postdated checks or similar instruments (including electronic form or otherwise) unless You follow the procedure for stop payments."
3,33,"8. OTHER PROVISIONS CARDHOLDER BENEFITS AND REWARDS: We may provide You with the opportunity to earn cardholder benefits and rewards with respect to Your Account. If We do, We will separately provide You with the terms and conditions applicable to these opportunities. If there is any rewards membership fee on Your Account, it will be outlined in Your rewards terms and conditions document and will be charged to Your Account as a Purchase. Cardholder benefits and rewards are subject to change or termination without notice.

When the term “You” is used in this provision on “Claims” or in the provisions on “Limitations on Claims” or “Arbitration,” that term means You and any of the following people who will be considered “Your Related Parties”: any co-applicant, co-signer, joint cardholder, authorized user or guarantor on Your Account, Your heirs and Your trustee in bankruptcy. References to “Our Related Parties” in this Agreement includes affiliated third parties such as Our parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates and Our and their officers, directors, agents, employees, representatives, successors and assigns. “Our Related Parties” also include unaffiliated third parties that provide products, services or benefits (to You or to Us) in connection with Your Account or that have otherwise participated in the marketing or servicing of Your Account. Any Claim or Claims brought by or on behalf of a class, brought in a representative capacity or otherwise on a class basis, or brought in the form of a private attorney general action are referred to as “Class Proceedings” regardless of whether they are commenced in court or in arbitration."
3,40,"LIMITATIONS ON CLAIMS/NOTICE AND CURE:: Before We bring a Claim against You, We must notify You in writing of Our Claim, including the amount of the Claim. If We have a Claim based on a payment obligation that You may have to Us: (1) Our notification requirement will be considered satisfied by sending You a Billing Statement within the time required by applicable law and regulation; and (2) You will be afforded the period of time allowed by this Agreement and applicable law to make the payment before We commence court proceedings or arbitration.

3,41,"ARBITRATION: THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY: WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ALLOWS EITHER PARTY TO REQUIRE THAT ANY “CLAIM” (AS DEFINED ABOVE) BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU MAY REJECT THE ARBITRATION PROVISION BY SENDING US WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN 45 DAYS AFTER YOUR FIRST PURCHASE, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND TO HAVE A CLAIM DETERMINED BY A JURY. OTHER RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE IN COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR APPEAL RIGHTS, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, THOSE OTHER RIGHTS ARE WAIVED. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THESE TWO THINGS (IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION): (1) BRING A CLAIM AS A CLASS ACTION OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY; OR (2) PARTICIPATE IN A CLAIM AS A CLASS MEMBER."
3,42,"Except as provided below: (1) You may unilaterally choose to have any Claim that We bring against You resolved through binding arbitration; and (2) We may unilaterally choose to have any Claim that You bring against Us (or Us and any of Our Related Parties) resolved through binding arbitration. If You assert a Claim against any of Our Related Parties, but You do not also assert that Claim against Us, the Related Party (or whoever will be defending the Related Party) may unilaterally choose to have that Claim resolved through binding arbitration. If a court proceeding is commenced, the party that commenced that court proceeding may unilaterally choose to have any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third party claim brought in that proceeding resolved through binding arbitration. If a party chooses to have a Claim resolved by arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision, neither You nor We will have the right to litigate that Claim in court, have a jury trial on that Claim, or engage in pre-arbitration discovery, except as provided for in the applicable Arbitration Rules of the selected Arbitrator(s) and as otherwise set forth in this arbitration provision"
3,43,"“Ordinary Claims” are not subject to this arbitration provision and may be resolved through litigation. A Claim will be considered an “Ordinary Claim” if the Claim is filed by You or Us in a small claims court so long as (1) the Claim is within the scope of its jurisdiction, (2) the Claim remains in such court; and (3) the only parties to litigation to resolve the Claim will be You, Us and/or Related Parties."
3,44,Arbitrations shall be conducted by one or more impartial arbitrators (the “Arbitrator(s)”). An Arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge.
3,45,"Arbitrations shall be conducted through a national arbitration organization with reasonable experience in financial and consumer disputes (referred to as an “Administrator”). Arbitration may be commenced in accordance with the Rules of the chosen Administrator. Rules and forms may be obtained from, and Claims may be filed with, JAMS at 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, or jamsadr.com; or the AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New York, New York 10017, or adr.org. More information regarding arbitration procedures and arbitration rosters also may be obtained from JAMS or the AAA at the addresses or websites above. If neither such Administrator is available to conduct a consumer credit card-related arbitration, the Administrator shall be the one mutually agreed upon by You and Us. Arbitration through an Administrator shall be conducted in accordance with the arbitration rules and procedures of the Administrator, which are applicable and in effect when the Claim is initiated (the “Arbitration Rules”). For Arbitrations with an Administrator, the Administrator shall provide and designate a listing of potential Arbitrators to conduct the arbitration. The Arbitrator shall be selected from the Administrator’s listing and will be the Arbitrator(s) mutually agreed upon by You and Us."
3,46,"Or, if You and We agree, the arbitration shall proceed by an Arbitrator without an Administrator. Arbitration without an Administrator shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect when the Claim is initiated, with the Arbitrator taking the place of the AAA therein (also, the “Arbitration Rules”). For arbitrations without an Administrator, the Arbitrator(s) shall be mutually agreed upon by You and Us."
3,47,"If the Arbitration Rules are inconsistent with this arbitration provision, this provision will prevail. Arbitrations may be initiated pursuant to the Arbitration Rules. You or We may choose to have an arbitration hearing. You and We may be represented by counsel throughout any arbitration. For Claims of $10,000 or less which are not pursued in small claims court, You may choose whether the Arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or without a hearing based only on the submissions made by You and Us. If You want to have a hearing in person, You have the right to have the hearing conducted in Your hometown area which shall not be outside the county in which You are billed. You and We agree to exchange such non-privileged information as the Arbitrator shall require. The decision of the Arbitrator(s) will be final and binding. Any final decision of the Arbitrator(s) is subject to judicial review only as set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment upon an award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction."
3,48,"If there is a dispute as to whether any claim, dispute or controversy is a “Claim” subject to this provision, that dispute shall be resolved solely by the Arbitrator(s) (except as noted below with reference to Class Proceedings and except that a court may decide whether a Claim is an Ordinary Claim). An arbitration pursuant to this provision may decide only Your Claims, Our Claims or Claims of Related Parties. The Arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to entertain or determine Class Proceedings. If the Arbitrator(s) decide they have authority to entertain or determine any Claim brought in a Class Proceeding, that decision may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction. If, despite this Agreement, Class Proceedings are allowed, those proceedings shall be conducted only in a court of competent jurisdiction. The claims of other persons who may (or may not) have similar claims may not be consolidated with any Claim. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. The only Claims that may be joined under this arbitration provision are (1) those brought by Us and Our Related Parties against You and Your Related Parties; or (2) those brought by You and Your Related Parties against Us and Our Related Parties."
3,49,"The Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to award any remedy under applicable state or federal law, including punitive damages. An Arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based"
3,50,"If any portion of this arbitration provision shall be found to be unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will remain in effect.

We encourage You to address all Claims You have in a single Dispute Claim Notice and/or a single arbitration. Accordingly, this $10,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims You have asserted or could have asserted in the arbitration, and multiple awards of $10,000 are not contemplated. All other fees will be allocated in keeping with the applicable Arbitration Rules and applicable law. We will also advance or reimburse other fees if the Administrator or Arbitrator(s) determine there is good reason for requiring Us to do so or if You ask Us and We determine there is good cause for doing so.

3,67,"Page 2 2 of 4 How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called “average daily balance (including new purchases).” Loss of Introductory APR: We may end your introductory APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers and apply the Penalty APR if you make a late payment. Index and When It Is Determined: The Index used to determine your variable APRs is the U.S. Prime Rate shown in the “Money Rates” section of The Wall Street Journal on the last day the rate is published in each calendar month (the determination date). The Index will be effective for the entire billing cycle that ends in the second month after the determination date. For example, if your billing cycle ends in July, we will use the Index determined on the last day the rate is published in The Wall Street Journal in May. APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers: To determine the APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers, we add a margin of 10.74% - 16.74% to the Index (Prime Rate) not to exceed the maximum APR 24.99%. APR for Cash Advances: To determine the APR for Cash Advances, we add a margin of 21.74% to the Index (Prime Rate) not to exceed a maximum APR of 24.99%. APR for Cash Equivalent Transactions: Cash Equivalent Transactions will be treated as Cash Advances for all purposes of your account, including the APR that applies to such transactions. Cash Equivalent Transactions will be charged a fee as indicated in the Fees table in this document. Cash Equivalent Transactions are those transactions performed using a merchant or service provider that VISA® or MasterCard® identifies as a seller of traveler’s checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, lottery tickets, funds used for wagers or gambling, or similar products or services. Penalty APR: We may increase Annual Percentage Rates on your future transactions if you: (1) fail to make a minimum payment to us when due; (2) exceed your credit limit with us; or (3) make a payment to us that is returned (dishonored) for any reason. We may also increase the Annual Percentage Rates on all your balances and transactions if you are more than 60 days late in making a required minimum payment. The amount of an APR increase may be based on how you have handled your account with us and current and historical information regarding your credit in general. These increases will be subject to the requirements of applicable law. IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CHANGES IN TERMS. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to unilaterally change the APRs, fees and other terms at any time, including after your account is closed. If we make changes, we will send you all notices required by law. You understand that the terms of your account, including APRs, are subject to change. APRs are not guaranteed and they may change to higher APRs. We may also change whether your rates will be variable or not. Application of Payments: We may apply your minimum payment in the order we select, subject to applicable law. However, in general, if you make a payment in excess of the required minimum payment, we will apply the excess amount first to your balances with the highest Annual Percentage Rate. Any remaining portion of that excess amount will be applied to your other balances in descending order based on their applicable Annual Percentage Rates. Please Note: Your account generally will have monthly billing cycles, except that your first billing cycle may be more or less than one month. All credit terms, including minimum interest charges, will apply in each billing cycle including the first billing cycle. BALANCE TRANSFERS: We may permit you to transfer balances from other credit card companies or financial institutions (“Other Accounts”) to your account if you are approved. All Balance Transfer requests are subject to our approval; we are not liable if we do not accept a requested Balance Transfer. We reserve the right to make Balance Transfers in the order we select and to limit the amount of the Balance Transfers that we make (this amount may be less than your total credit limit). If you request an amount that we do not approve, we may process a partial transfer for less than you requested or we may decline the entire request. You may not transfer any balance you owe from any other MidFirst Bank account or any of your accounts with any of our related companies. You should not transfer any amount that is in dispute in order to preserve your dispute rights. You should continue to monitor the Other Accounts that you request to transfer balances from, and you should continue to pay the minimum payments due on the Other Accounts until you receive statements from those creditors showing that the balances due on the Other Accounts have been paid in full. This may not happen until after the Balance Transfer appears on your billing statement from us. You are liable for any late payments, interest charges or disputed amounts on your Other Accounts. If you want your Other Accounts closed following a Balance Transfer, you are responsible for doing so. Balance Transfers are subject to applicable fees and interest charges and do not have the benefit of a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate, also known as a grace period. CREDIT REPORTS: By applying for this account, you agree that MidFirst Bank, acting directly or through its 1st Century Bank, division may obtain credit reports for purposes of processing your application and for later purposes related to your account such as increasing the credit line and for collection purposes.

If any Annual Percentage Rate is not expressly labeled or described as “fixed,” it is variable."
4,15,"VARIABLE RATE INFORMATION: If any Annual Percentage Rate is variable, Your rate is determined by adding the applicable margin to the applicable Index, as described in the Disclosure. The daily periodic rate is 1/365th (1/366th during leap years) of the Annual Percentage Rate."
4,16,"INCREASED AND/OR PENALTY RATES: If We do not receive Your required Minimum Payment by its due date, You exceed Your Credit Limit, or You make a payment to Us that is dishonored or returned for any reason, We may increase any or all of Your Annual Percentage Rates on future transactions (including, but not limited to Special Offer Rates). We also may increase the Annual Percentage Rates on all Your balances and transactions, including those incurred prior to the notice of increase, if We do not receive Your required Minimum Payment within 60 days after its due date. If We increase Your rates, We may determine the amount of the increase based on historical information regarding Your Account and Your credit in general. We will give You a notice of the increase. The highest rate that may apply will be the “Penalty Rate” (or “Penalty APR”) shown on the Disclosure, subject to applicable law. However, increased rates will cease to apply if We receive six consecutive monthly Minimum Payments on or before their payment due dates, beginning with the first payment due date following the effective date of the increase. When a Penalty Rate ceases to apply, the interest rate in effect before the increase will again apply as disclosed."
4,17,"ACCRUAL OF INTEREST CHARGES: We will accrue Periodic Rate Interest Charges on each of the Balance Categories from the date of each transaction or the first day of the Billing Cycle in which the transaction is added to Your Account, whichever is later"
4,18,"GRACE PERIOD: We will not charge You any interest on Purchases if You pay Your entire balance by the due date each month; this is called the “Grace Period.” Payment in full is generally required to obtain the benefit of the Grace Period. However, We will give You the benefit of the Grace Period for partial payments to the extent required by law. The Grace Period applies only to Purchases and, if applicable, Special Offers. The Grace Period does not apply to Balance Transfers or Cash Advances."
4,19,"PERIODIC RATE INTEREST CHARGES: “Periodic Rate Interest Charges” are charges to Your Account based on the application of Annual Percentage Rates, and will be calculated using daily periodic rates which correspond to applicable Annual Percentage Rates. These rates may vary by Balance Category. (A) If Your Account was opened with an Introductory Rate(s), the rate(s) for Your Account will be at the Introductory Rate(s) shown on the Disclosure and will continue in effect as shown on the Disclosure. (B) After the Introductory Rate(s) expire or if Your Account does not have an Introductory Rate, the Annual Percentage Rate(s) for Your Account will be the rate(s) shown on the Disclosure. (C) The Annual Percentage Rate(s) applicable to any Special Offers and circumstances under which it will apply will be provided to You when We make the offer."
4,20,"INTEREST CHARGES AND BALANCE CALCULATIONS: We use the Average Daily Balance (including new Purchases) method to compute a portion of the interest charges on Your Account. We calculate Periodic Rate Interest Charges separately for each Balance Category. (A) To compute billed Periodic Rate Interest Charges: (1) For each Balance Category, We multiply Your “Daily Balance” (see below) by the applicable daily periodic rate for each day of the Billing Cycle; then (2) We add together all of the amounts calculated in (1) above. (B) To compute the “Daily Balance” for each Balance Category: (1) We take the beginning balance of the Balance Category each day; (2) Add any new transactions (such as purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and debit adjustments, as applicable) and any new fees applicable to that Balance Category; and (3) Subtract any payments, credits, credit adjustments, non-accruing fees and unpaid interest charges applicable to that Balance Category."
4,21,"We treat a credit balance as a balance of zero. Also, for purposes of these computations, We may delay adding some fees to Your Daily Balance for each Balance Category (for example, some fees may not be added to Your Daily Balance until the Billing Cycle after they are imposed). We may also subtract some payments or portions of some payments from Your Daily Balance of each Balance Category earlier than when they were actually received (for example, for Grace Period purposes, portions of some payments received in one Billing Cycle may be considered applied to Your Purchase Balance Category or Special Offer Balance Category, as applicable, at the end of the prior Billing Cycle)."
4,22,We add the amount calculated in accordance with (A)(1) above to the Daily Balance for each Balance Category and this amount becomes the beginning balance for that Balance Category for the next day.
4,23,"On Your Billing Statement, We will calculate an “Average Daily Balance” for each Balance Category by adding all Your Daily Balances for that Balance Category and dividing that amount by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. If You multiply the Average Daily Balance for a Balance Category by its daily periodic rate and multiply the result by the number of days in the Billing Cycle, the total will equal the billed Periodic Rate Interest Charges for that Balance Category, except for minor variations due to rounding."
4,24,Billed Periodic Rate Interest Charges will appear on Your Billing Statement labeled as “Interest Charge” for each Balance Category. The Interest Charges for each Balance Category will be totaled on Your Billing Statement and listed as the “Total Interest.” This Agreement provides for daily compounding of interest charges and fees.
4,25,"BALANCE TRANSFERS AND BALANCE TRANSFER FEES: We may permit You to transfer balances from other credit card companies or financial institutions (“Other Accounts”) to Your Account. All Balance Transfer requests are subject to Our approval; We are not liable if We do not accept a requested Balance Transfer. We reserve the right to process Balance Transfers in the order We select and to limit the amount of any Balance Transfers that We may process (this amount may be less than Your Credit Limit). If You request an amount that We do not approve, We may process a partial transfer for less than You requested or We may decline the entire request. You may not transfer any balance You owe from any other MidFirst account or any of Your accounts with any of Our related companies. You should not transfer any amount that is in dispute in order to preserve Your dispute rights. You should continue to monitor the Other Accounts from which You have requested a balance be transferred to Your Account and You should continue to pay the minimum payments due on the Other Accounts until You receive confirmation from those creditors showing that the balances due on the Other Accounts have been paid in full. This may not happen until after the Balance Transfer appears on Your Billing Statement from Us. We are not liable for any late payments, interest or finance charges or disputed amounts on Your Other Accounts. If You want Your Other Accounts closed following a Balance Transfer, You are responsible for doing so. We will charge You a Balance Transfer Fee for each Balance Transfer as shown on the Disclosure. Balance Transfer Fees will be added to Your Balance Transfers Balance Category"
4,26,CASH ADVANCE FEES: A Cash Advance Fee will be imposed for each Cash Advance transaction as shown on the Disclosure and added to Your Cash Advances Balance Category.
4,27,"CASH EQUIVALENT TRANSACTION FEES: A Cash Advance Fee will be charged for each Cash Equivalent Transaction as indicated on the Disclosure. “Cash Equivalent Transactions” are those transactions performed using a merchant or service provider that Visa® or MasterCard® identifies as a seller of traveler’s checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, lottery tickets, funds used for wagers or gambling, or similar products or services. These transactions are also treated as Cash Advances for all other purposes on Your Account, including the Annual Percentage Rate that applies to the Account. Cash Advance Fees will be added to Your Cash Advances Balance Category."
4,28,FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEES: A Foreign Transaction Fee may be assessed on all transactions made a.) in currencies other than U.S. dollars; (b.) with a foreign merchant; or (c.) outside the United States. The foreign transaction fee will be equal to a certain percentage of the amount of each foreign transaction (after conversion to U.S. dollars) as shown on the Disclosure. These fees will be added to the Balance Category that We select.
4,29,"ANNUAL FEE: : If Your Account has an annual fee, it is shown on the accompanying Disclosure and will be charged to Your Account as a Purchase."
4,30,"OTHER FEES: We may charge additional fees from time to time. The amount charged for these fees is shown in the Disclosure unless otherwise indicated. Each of the below fees will be added to the Balance Category that We select. Late Payment Fee.

4,31,"TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Transactions made in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be converted to U.S. dollars under the current regulations of Visa®, MasterCard® or the Visa®/PLUS® ATM Network. Those regulations currently provide that the conversion rate may be either (a.) a wholesale market rate or (b.) a government-mandated rate. Visa® and MasterCard® currently use the rate in effect on the date they process Your transaction. The currency conversion rate in effect on the date Your transaction is processed may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date. The Visa®/ PLUS® ATM Network currently uses the rate in effect on the transaction date."
4,32,"5.

Our acceptance of a payment after one or more of the above-listed events does not waive Our right to pursue any other lawful remedies to which We are entitled under law."
4,33,"COLLECTION COSTS: You agree to pay all of Our reasonable costs incurred in pursuing collection of the amount You owe, including attorneys’ fees"
4,34,"TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF CREDIT PRIVILEGES: We may at any time, with or without cause and without advance notice, terminate this Agreement and/or temporarily or permanently suspend Your credit privileges.

Any such course of dealing or course of performance on Our part shall not be considered as an additional legal obligation to You under this Agreement.

YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THESE TWO THINGS (IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION): (1) BRING A CLAIM AS A CLASS ACTION OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY; OR (2) PARTICIPATE IN A CLAIM AS A CLASS MEMBER."
4,47,"Except as provided below: (1) You may unilaterally choose to have any Claim that We bring against You resolved through binding arbitration; and (2) We may unilaterally choose to have any Claim that You bring against Us (or Us and any of Our Related Parties) resolved through binding arbitration. If You assert a Claim against any of Our Related Parties, but You do not also assert that Claim against Us, the Related Party (or whoever will be defending the Related Party) may unilaterally choose to have that Claim resolved through binding arbitration. If a court proceeding is commenced, the party that commenced that court proceeding may unilaterally choose to have any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third party claim brought in that proceeding resolved through binding arbitration. If a party chooses to have a Claim resolved by arbitration pursuant to this arbitration provision, neither You nor We will have the right to litigate that Claim in court, have a jury trial on that Claim, or engage in pre-arbitration discovery, except as provided for in the applicable Arbitration Rules of the selected Arbitrator(s) and as otherwise set forth in this arbitration provision “Ordinary Claims” are not subject to this arbitration provision and may be resolved through litigation. A Claim will be considered an “Ordinary Claim” if the Claim is filed by You or Us in a small claims court so long as (1) the Claim is within the scope of its jurisdiction, (2) the Claim remains in such court; and (3) the only parties to litigation to resolve the Claim will be You, Us and/or Related Parties."
4,48,"Arbitrations shall be conducted by one or more impartial arbitrators (the “Arbitrator(s)”). An Arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least ten years of experience or a retired judge. Arbitrations shall be conducted through a national arbitration organization with reasonable experience in financial and consumer disputes (referred to as an “Administrator”). Arbitration may be commenced in accordance with the Rules of the chosen Administrator. Rules and forms may be obtained from, and Claims may be filed with, JAMS at 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, or jamsadr.com; or the AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10, New York, New York 10017, or adr.org. More information regarding arbitration procedures and arbitration rosters also may be obtained from JAMS or the AAA at the addresses or websites above. If neither such Administrator is available to conduct a consumer credit card-related arbitration, the Administrator shall be the one mutually agreed upon by You and Us. Arbitration through an Administrator shall be conducted in accordance with the arbitration rules and procedures of the Administrator, which are applicable and in effect when the Claim is initiated (the “Arbitration Rules”). For Arbitrations with an Administrator, the Administrator shall provide and designate a listing of potential Arbitrators to conduct the arbitration. The Arbitrator shall be selected from the Administrator’s listing and will be the Arbitrator(s) mutually agreed upon by You and Us."
4,49,"Or, if You and We agree, the arbitration shall proceed by an Arbitrator without an Administrator. Arbitration without an Administrator shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect when the Claim is initiated, with the Arbitrator taking the place of the AAA therein (also, the “Arbitration Rules”). For arbitrations without an Administrator, the Arbitrator(s) shall be mutually agreed upon by You and Us. If the Arbitration Rules are inconsistent with this arbitration provision, this provision will prevail. Arbitrations may be initiated pursuant to the Arbitration Rules. You or We may choose to have an arbitration hearing. You and We may be represented by counsel throughout any arbitration. For Claims of $10,000 or less which are not pursued in small claims court, You may choose whether the Arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or without a hearing based only on the submissions made by You and Us. If You want to have a hearing in person, You have the right to have the hearing conducted in Your hometown area which shall not be outside the county in which You are billed. You and We agree to exchange such non-privileged information as the Arbitrator shall require. The decision of the Arbitrator(s) will be final and binding. Any final decision of the Arbitrator(s) is subject to judicial review only as set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment upon an award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If there is a dispute as to whether any claim, dispute or controversy is a “Claim” subject to this provision, that dispute shall be resolved solely by the Arbitrator(s) (except as noted below with reference to Class Proceedings and except that a court may decide whether a Claim is an Ordinary Claim)."
4,50,"An arbitration pursuant to this provision may decide only Your Claims, Our Claims or Claims of Related Parties. The Arbitrator(s) shall have no authority to entertain or determine Class Proceedings. If the Arbitrator(s) decide they have authority to entertain or determine any Claim brought in a Class Proceeding, that decision may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction. If, despite this Agreement, Class Proceedings are allowed, those proceedings shall be conducted only in a court of competent jurisdiction. The claims of other persons who may (or may not) have similar claims may not be consolidated with any Claim. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. The only Claims that may be joined under this arbitration provision are (1) those brought by Us and Our Related Parties against You and Your Related Parties; or (2) those brought by You and Your Related Parties against Us and Our Related Parties. The Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to award any remedy under applicable state or federal law, including punitive damages. An Arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based"
4,51,"If any portion of this arbitration provision shall be found to be unenforceable, that portion will be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will remain in effect. However, if the Class Action Waiver is held to be invalid with respect to any Class Proceeding, the entire arbitration provision shall be null and void. We will reimburse You for the initial arbitration filing fee up to $350 upon receipt of proof of payment, provided that You have initiated an individualized proceeding in good faith and in accordance with this Agreement and provided that You have not initiated Your proceeding in concert with any other cardholder(s). If, and only if, (i) You submit a Dispute Claim Notice in accordance with this paragraph on Your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party); (ii) You cooperate with Us by promptly providing the information We reasonably request; (iii) We refuse to provide You with the relief You request before an arbitrator is appointed; and (iv) the matter then proceeds to arbitration and the arbitrator subsequently determines that You were entitled to such relief (or greater relief), You will be entitled to a minimum award of at least $10,000 and Your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. We encourage You to address all Claims You have in a single Dispute Claim Notice and/or a single arbitration. Accordingly, this $10,000 minimum award is a single award that applies to all Claims You have asserted or could have asserted in the arbitration, and multiple awards of $10,000 are not contemplated. All other fees will be allocated in keeping with the applicable Arbitration Rules and applicable law. We will also advance or reimburse other fees if the Administrator or Arbitrator(s) determine there is good reason for requiring Us to do so or if You ask Us and We determine there is good cause for doing so. Except as provided above, each party will bear the expense of the fees and costs of that party’s own attorneys, experts, witnesses, documents and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails."

After We finish Our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If We made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If We do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send You a Statement of the amount You owe and the date payment is due. We may then report You as delinquent if You do not pay the amount We think You owe. If You receive Our explanation but still believe Your bill is wrong, You must write to Us within 10 days telling Us that You still refuse to pay. If You do so, We cannot report You as delinquent without also reporting that You are questioning Your bill. We must tell You the name of anyone to whom We reported You as delinquent, and We must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between Us. If We do not follow all of the rules above, You do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount You question even if Your bill is correc"

4,66,"How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called “average daily balance (including new purchases).” Security Interest: This is an application for a secured credit card account. If your application is approved, as a condition for opening the secured credit card account, you agree to provide MidFirst Bank either acting directly or through its 1st Century Bank division (“Bank”) with funds that will be used to open a deposit account in your name and to grant Bank a security interest in the account which will serve as collateral for your credit card obligations to us (the “Collateral”). You may not withdraw the Collateral at any time while it secures your credit card, including interest, fees and charges which may accrue under your secured credit card account. The Collateral will be returned to you only if you close your secured credit card account and pay your balance in full. If you fail to pay or otherwise default on your credit card obligations to us or if your secured credit card account is terminated for any reason, we may, subject to applicable law: (1) without advance notice, take any or all of the Collateral and apply it as payment towards your credit card account obligations; and (2) pursue other legal remedies. If any Collateral remains after doing so, it may remain on deposit for up to 90 days before being remitted to you. A division of MidFirst Ban"
4,67,"Page 2 2 of 3 SECURED CREDIT CARD APPLICATION DISCLOSURE Index and When It Is Determined: The Index used to determine your variable APRs is the U.S. Prime Rate shown in the “Money Rates” section of The Wall Street Journal on the last day the rate is published in each calendar month (the determination date). The Index will be effective for the entire billing cycle that ends in the second month after the determination date. For example, if your billing cycle ends in July, we will use the Index determined on the last day the rate is published in The Wall Street Journal in May. APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers: To determine the APR for Purchases and Balance Transfers, we add a margin of 14.74% to the Index (Prime Rate) not to exceed a maximum APR of 24.99%. APR for Cash Advances: To determine the APR for Cash Advances, we add a margin of 21.74% to the Index (Prime Rate) not to exceed a maximum APR of 24.99%. APR for Cash Equivalent Transactions: Cash Equivalent Transactions will be treated as Cash Advances for all purposes of your account, including the APR that applies to such transactions. Cash Equivalent Transactions will be charged a fee as indicated in the Fees table in this document. Cash Equivalent Transactions are those transactions performed using a merchant or service provider that VISA® or MasterCard® identifies as a seller of traveler’s checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers, lottery tickets, funds used for wagers or gambling or similar products or services. Penalty APR: We may increase Annual Percentage Rates on your future transactions if you: (1) fail to make a minimum payment to us when due; (2) exceed your credit limit with us; or (3) make a payment to us that is returned (dishonored) for any reason. We may also increase the Annual Percentage Rates on all your balances and transactions if you are more than 60 days late in making a required minimum payment. The amount of an APR increase may be based on how you have handled your account with us and current and historical information regarding your credit in general. These increases will be subject to the requirements of applicable law."
4,68,"IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING CHANGES IN TERMS. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to unilaterally change the APRs, fees and other terms at any time, including after your account is closed. If we make changes, we will send you all notices required by law. You understand that the terms of your account, including APRs, are subject to change. APRs are not guaranteed and they may change to higher APRs. We may also change whether your rates will be variable or not. Application of Payments: We may apply your minimum payment in the order we select, subject to applicable law. However, in general, if you make a payment in excess of the required minimum payment, we will apply the excess amount first to your balances with the highest Annual Percentage Rate. Any remaining portion of that excess amount will be applied to your other balances in descending order based on their applicable Annual Percentage Rates. Please Note: Your account generally will have monthly billing cycles, except that your first billing cycle may be more or less than one month. All credit terms, including minimum interest charges, will apply in each billing cycle including the first billing cycle."

We reserve the right to make Balance Transfers in the order we select and to limit the amount of the Balance Transfers that we make (this amount may be less than your total credit limit). If you request an amount that we do not approve, we may process a partial transfer for less than you requested or we may decline the entire request. You may not transfer any balance you owe from any other MidFirst Bank account or any of your accounts with any of our related companies. You should not transfer any amount that is in dispute in order to preserve your dispute rights. You should continue to monitor the Other Accounts that you request to transfer balances from, and you should continue to pay the minimum payments due on the Other Accounts until you receive statements from those creditors showing that the balances due on the Other Accounts have been paid in full. This may not happen until after the Balance Transfer appears on your billing statement from us. You are liable for any late payments, interest charges or disputed amounts on your Other Accounts. If you want your Other Accounts closed following a Balance Transfer, you are responsible for doing so. Balance Transfers are subject to applicable fees and interest charges and do not have the benefit of a period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring a finance charge due to a periodic interest rate, also known as a grace period."

5,3,"CASH ADVANCES: You can obtain cash advances in any of the following three ways, subject to your available credit: using your credit card at a designated automated teller machine (ATM), presenting your credit card to a bank displaying a Mastercard® or Visa® sign, or using convenience checks that we may issue to you. By using an ATM, with a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that has been issued to you, you can obtain cash advances (loans) up to the limitations described herein, and subject to applicable ATM cash availability and regulations. We add the amount of each cash advance to the part of your account we call cash advances. You can obtain cash advances up to an aggregate amount of $1,010 in any calendar day beginning at 12:00 midnight (Central Time) and ending at 11:59:59 p.m. (Central Time) by presenting your credit card at any bank displaying a Mastercard or Visa sign or at an ATM, subject to the limitations stated in this agreement and further subject to applicable cash availability and the regulations of the bank or the ATM operator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of any cash advance that you may obtain during a single transaction from an ATM cannot exceed $510. You may use convenience checks we may issue to you in connection with your account to obtain cash advances up to your available credit. We may dishonor any check if your account is delinquent, it would cause your account to exceed your credit limit, or you are otherwise in violation of any provision of this agreement. You may stop payment on a convenience check if we have not paid the check and we receive your stop payment request by 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the business day prior to the business day on which we receive your check. If we do not receive your stop payment request by the time specified in this agreement, we are not required to stop payment on the check. You may notify us to stop payment orally or in writing. You may be required to send written confirmation of an oral stop payment request within 14 days. Your written stop payment request expires in six months from receipt by us of written confirmation unless you renew it in writing."
5,4,BALANCE TRANSFERS: You can transfer balances from other credit card accounts to your account up to your available credit by using convenience checks that we may issue to you. Balances that you transfer from other credit card accounts will be treated as a cash advance for purposes of this agreement.
5,5,"MONTHLY STATEMENTS: The Bank will send you a statement at the end of each monthly statement period on which there is a debit or credit balance of more than $1 or on which interest charges have been imposed. The statement will show all transactions, the unpaid balance on your account (called “New Balance”), your available credit (your credit limit less the New Balance), the Minimum Payment Due, the Total Payment Due and the Minimum Payment Due Date."
5,6,"PAYING INTEREST: Your Minimum Payment Due Date will be at least 21 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases first appearing on your current billing statement (new purchases), or any portion thereof, paid by the Minimum Payment Due Date shown on that statement if you paid the New Balance on your previous billing statement in full by the Minimum Payment Due Date shown on that statement. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date."
5,7,"CREDIT LIMIT: The Bank assigns you a credit limit when your account is approved. You promise not to allo w your unpaid balance to exceed your credit limit. If we allow you to make a purchase and/or obtain a cash advance which causes your balance to exceed your credit limit, you agree to pay the Bank the excess immediately. Permitting you to exceed your credit limit does not prevent the Bank from enforcing your credit line in the future. The Bank may increase your credit limit from time to time, at your request or upon review of your account. The Bank will notify you in writing if your credit limit is lowered for any reason."
5,8,"YOUR PAYMENT PROMISE: You agree to pay the Bank for all purchases and cash advances made on your account, together with interest charges when such charges are applicable according to the terms of this agreement."
5,9,"MAKING PAYMENTS: The Minimum Payment Due on each statement will be equal to the sum of all past due amounts plus the current billing cycle payment. The Total Payment Due on each statement will be equal to the sum of the Minimum Payment Due plus the amount by which your balance exceeds the credit limit and in no event will exceed the New Balance. The current billing cycle payment will be equal to 1% of the New Balance shown on that statement (excluding any interest charge and late fee assessed for that billing cycle and, if applicable, one-twelfth of any annual fee assessed to your account) plus any interest charge and late fee assessed for that billing cycle plus, if applicable, one-twelfth of any annual fee assessed to your account. The Minimum Payment Due will not be less than $25, unless the entire New Balance or the interest charges on your account are less than $25, in which case the Minimum Payment Due will be equal to the entire New Balance. If the entire New Balance is greater than $25 and consists only of interest charges, the Minimum Payment Due will be equal to the interest charges. For each Minimum Payment Due that is greater than $25, the Minimum Payment Due will be rounded to the next highest whole dollar. Credits to your account which result from credits initiated by merchants from whom you purchased goods or services using your credit card or credits issued by the Bank shall not constitute a payment. If you pay more than the Minimum Payment Due, the excess is credited to your account, and your balance is reduced accordingly."
5,10,"The Bank may not require you to make the Minimum Payment Due during certain designated billing cycles. When the Bank offers you this skip-payment option, and you do not make the Minimum Payment Due during any billing period, interest charges will continue to apply to your account as provided in this agreement."
5,11,"IRREGULAR PAYMENTS: The Bank may accept late payments, partial payment, or checks or money orders labeled “payment in full” without losing its rights under this agreement."
5,12,"APPLYING PAYMENTS: Any payment received in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be allocated first to the balance bearing the highest annual percentage rate and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate until the excess payment is exhausted. The amount of any payment received that is equal to or less than the Minimum Payment Due and credits will be allocated in the manner we determine. In most instances, we will allocate such payments and credits to balances with lower annual percentage rates before balances with higher rates."
5,13,CREDITING PAYMENTS: Payments received by 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) will be credited to your account as of the date of receipt if received in readily identifiable form in the specified manner and at the specified location. Payments received after 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) will be credited to your account as of the next calendar day if received in readily identifiable form in the specified manner and at the specified location.
5,14,"PROCESSING PAYMENTS: The Bank may process payments made by check electronically by transmitting the routing number, account number and check serial number to your bank. The Bank may also electronically re - present checks that are returned for insufficient or uncollected funds."
5,15,"INTEREST CHARGES: The Bank figures the interest charge on your account by multiplying the applicable daily periodic rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of purchases and “Average Daily Balance” of cash advances, and then multiplying the products by the number of days in the billing cycle. The annual percentage rate is shown on the monthly statement for the billing period covered by each statement. The “Average Daily Balance” of purchases and cash advances is computed separately as follows:"
5,16,"For Purchases–Average Daily Balance (including New Purchases): To get the “Average Daily Balance,” the Bank starts with the beginning balance of purchases on your account each day, including billed and unpaid interest charges related to purchases, and adds any new purchases on which interest is charged and other debit adjustments and subtracts any payments or credits. This gives the Bank the daily balance. At the end of each day, the Bank multiplies the daily balance by the daily periodic rate. The result is then added to the daily balance to determine the next day’s beginning balance. If the daily balance is negative, then it is considered to be zero. At the end of the statement period, the Bank adds up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divides by the total numb er of days in the billing cycle to get the “Average Daily Balance.” This method of calculating the “Average Daily Balance” involves daily compounding of interest charges."
5,17,"For Cash Advances–Average Daily Balance (including New Advances): To get the “Average Daily Balance,” the Bank starts with the beginning balance of cash advances on your account each day, including billed and unpaid interest charges related to cash advances, and adds any new advances and other debit adjustments and subtracts any payments or credits. This gives the Bank the daily balance. At the end of each day, the Bank multiplies the daily balance by the daily periodic rate. The result is then added to the daily balance to determine the next day’s beginning balance. If the daily balance is negative, then it is considered to be zero. At the end of the statement period, the Bank adds up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divides by the total number of days in the billing cycle to get the “Average Daily Balance.” This method of calculating the “Average Daily Balance” involves daily compounding of interest charges."
5,18,"There is no time in which you can pay the balance of cash advances in order to completely avoid interest charges. Interest Rate Adjustments: The Annual Percentage Rate (“APR”) is a variable rate (other than on purchases for the period from the date your account is open until the last day of the 12th billing cycle after your account is open) and will be adjusted according to the Index Rate. The Index Rate is the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the billing cycle commences. The daily periodic rate is determined by dividing the APR currently in effect by 365, and then trun cating that number to the nearest one hundred thousandth percent. The rate so determined will remain in effect until the first day of the next billing cycle, when it will be adjusted again."
5,19,"The APR is 0% on purchases for the period from the date your account is open until the last day of the 12th billing cycle after your account is open (promotional period). This is a daily periodic rate of 0%. The APR is 26.65 percentage points above the Index Rate on purchases after the last day of the promotional perio d and on cash advances. This APR as of the date set forth below is 29.9%, which is a daily periodic rate of .08191%. The APR (other than during the promotional period) will increase if there is an increase in the Index Rate. An increase in the Index Rate may result in an increase in the minimum monthly payment. The APR (other than during the promotional period) will decrease if there is a decrease in the Index Rate."
5,20,"The APRs will never be increased above the maximum rate permitted by law. The foregoing APRs and daily periodic rates are based on the Index Rate as of September 30, 2021, and are estimates. To obtain each APR currently in effect, call the Bank (toll-free) at 1-800-733-1732. There is a minimum interest charge of 50¢ for each billing period in which an interest charge is imposed."
5,21,"CASH ADVANCE FEE: For each cash advance obtained, or recorded during a billing period, by presenting your credit card at any bank or other financial institution displaying the Mastercard or Visa sign, by using a convenience check that we may issue to you, or by using an ATM, you may be charged a fee by us of the greater of $3 or 3 percent of the amount of such advance and may also be charged a fee by the other bank, financial institution or ATM operator. For the purchase of any foreign currency, money order, wire transfer, person-to-person money transfer, or other item that is directly convertible to cash made using your credit card, you may also be charged a fee of the greater of $3 or 3 percent of the amount of such transaction. This fee as well as any fee charged by another bank, financial institution or ATM operator will be added to your cash advance balance. If a fee charged by another bank, financial institution or ATM operator causes the amount of an advance to exceed the applicable limit, it will be declined."
5,22,"LATE PAYMENT FEE: If the Minimum Payment Due is not received by the Bank by the Minimum Payment Due Date, you may be charged a late payment fee of up to $29 for the first late payment and up to $40 for any additional late payment that occurs during the next six billing cycles after a late payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall such fee exceed the amount of the Minimum Payment Due immediately prior to the assessment of such fee, which may include any past due amount from prior billing cycles. This fee will be added to your purchases balance."
5,23,"RETURNED PAYMENT FEE: If a payment of any type (including without limitation payment by check or electronic funds transfer) made to your account is returned or otherwise not honored for any reason, you may be charged a fee of up to $29 for the first returned payment and up to $40 for any additional returned payment that occurs during the next six billing cycles after a returned payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall such fee exceed the amount of the Minimum Payment Due immediately prior to the date on which the payment was returned to us or otherwise not honored. This fee will be added to your purchases balance."
5,24,"REPLACEMENT CARD FEE: If your card is lost or stolen and/or you request that a new card be issued to you, you may be charged a fee of $10. If you request that a new or replacement card be issued to you on an expedited basis, you may be charged a fee of $25. These fees will be added to your purchases balance."
5,25,"ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE: Following the last day of the twelfth (12th) billing cycle after your account is open, you may be charged an annual fee of $25 if your credit limit is less than $1,000 and $55 if your credit limit is equal to or greater than $1,000. This fee will be added to your purchases balance"
5,26,"COPY FEE: For each copy of any statement or sales, refund, or cash advance slip you request from the Bank, you may be charged $3. This fee will be added to your purchases balance"
5,27,CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE: Credit life insurance is not required
5,28,"LIMITS ON CARD USE: The Bank is not required to authorize a purchase or cash advance if: (1) it would cause your balance to exceed your credit limit; (2) payment of your entire balance has been accelerated; (3) your credit card has expired; (4) we have revoked your right to use your credit card; or (5) your account has been closed. Any purchase or cash advance authorized by the Bank, even if the Bank is not required to, will be governed by the terms and conditions of this agreement. Your credit card may not be used for any illegal transaction"
5,29,"COLLECTION COSTS: If your account is more than thirty (30) days delinquent, the Bank may refer your account to collection, including the Bank’s own collection department, and you agree to pay all collection costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees and, as liquidated damages, the sum of $100 to compensate the Bank for the additional costs incurred in collection. It is expressly agreed that the exact amount of collection costs are difficult to ascertain and that $100 represents the Bank’s best estimate of this cost and not a penalty. This amount will be added to your purchases balance."
5,30,"JOINT ACCOUNT: If this is a joint account, each person who signed the application (1) may obtain purchase and cash advances (but the total of these cannot exceed the credit limit); (2) will be responsible for paying all amounts owed; and (3) can close the account."
5,31,"AUTHORIZED USER: You may, with the Bank’s permission, designate one or more other persons as an “Authorized User” of your account. If you do so, you will be responsible for all purchases, cash advances, fees and interest charges resulting from such authorized use. The Authorized User shall also be responsible for all purchases, cash advances, fees and interest charges resulting from his or her use of the account but the Bank is not required to seek recovery from the Authorized User before requiring payment by you. If you decide to terminate another person’s authorized use of your account the Bank must receive written notice from you together with the return of all credit cards issued to such person, cut in half. You remain responsible for payment of the purchases made or cash advances taken by the Authorized User up to the time the Bank receives your notice and the credit card(s). In addition, the Bank may but is not required to close your existing account and issue you a new card and account number."

The currency conversion rate calculated in this manner that is in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the posting date."

5,49,"This arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as it may be amended. This arbitration provision applies to any and all Claims that you have against us and/or any of our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, licensees, predecessors, successors, assigns, and against all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and assigns, or that we have against you. As used in this arbitration provision, the term Claim is to be given the broadest possible meaning. If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, the arbitration will be conducted as an individual action. Neither you nor we agree to any arbitration on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to proceed on such basis. This means that even if a class action lawsuit or other representative action is filed, such as that in the form of a private attorney general action, any Claim between us related to the issues raised in such lawsuit or action will be subject to an individual arbitration claim if either you or we elect so. As an exception to arbitration, you retain the right to pursue in a small claims court any Claim that is within the court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. The only claims that may be joined in an individual action under this arbitration provision are (1) those brought by us against you and any co-applicant, joint cardholder, or authorized user of your account, or your heirs or your trustee in bankruptcy, or (2) those brought by you or any co-applicant, joint cardholder, or authorized user of your account, or your heirs or your trustee in bankruptcy against us. You or we may elect arbitration under this arbitration provision with respect to any Claim, even if the Claim is part of a lawsuit brought in court. You or we may make a motion or request in court to compel arbitration of any Claim brought as part of any lawsuit. The party filing a Claim in arbitration must choose either of the following two arbitration administrators: American Arbitration Association or JAMS. These administrators are independent of us. The administrator does not conduct the arbitration. Arbitration is conducted under the rules of the selected arbitration administrator by an impartial third party chosen in accordance with the rules of the selected arbitration administration and as may be provided in this arbitration provision."

5,51,"In the alternative, if all parties agree, an independent third party selected by the pa rties may serve as arbitrator. If one of the arbitration administrators listed above is for any reason unable to provide timely arbitration services, the parties agrees that the other arbitration administrator shall administer the arbitration. If for any reason neither of the designated administrators is able to provide timely arbitration services, and the parties are unable to agree upon a third party to conduct the arbitration, then either party may apply to the federal district court in which the consumer resides for an order appointing an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5."
5,52,"Arbitration conducted pursuant to this arbitration provision shall be governed by the applicable procedures and rules of the arbitration administrator selected to arbitrate a Claim unless they conflict with this arbitration provision, in which case this arbitration provision will govern. Such procedures and rules may limit the amount of dis covery available to you or us. The arbitrator shall apply substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and will recognize c laims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator will take reasonable steps to protect confidential information, including the use of protective orders to prohibit the disclosure of such information outside the arbitration, if requested to do so by you or us.

Any arbitration hearing that you attend in person shall be held at a place chosen by the arbitrator or arbitrator administrator within the federal district in which you reside at the time the Claim is filed or at some other place to which you and we agree in writing.
5,54,Failure or delay in enforcing this arbitration provision at any time or in connection any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims.

6,2,APR for Cash Advances and Balance Transfers* 29.9% (which is a daily periodic rate of .08191%). This APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate plus a margin of 26.65 percentage points.
6,3,Paying Interest Your due date is at least 21 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date
6,4,"Minimum Interest Charge If you are charged interest, the charge will be no less than 50¢"
6,5,"Annual Fee No annual fee for one year, then $25 if your credit limit is less than $1,000 and $55 if your credit limit is equal to or greater than $1,000"

6,7,Penalty Fees  Late Payment  Returned Payment Up to $40 Up to $40
6,8,"Variable Rate Information The APR is a variable rate (other than on the Average Daily Balance of purchases for the period beginning on the date your account is open until the last day of the twelfth billing cycle after your account is open) and will be adjusted according to the Index Rate. The Index Rate is the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the billing cycle commences. The daily periodic rate is determined by dividing the APR currently in effect by 365, and then truncating that number to the nearest one hundred thousandth percent. The rate so determined will remain in effect until the first day of the next billing cycle, when it will be adjusted again. An increase in the Index Rate may result in an increase in the minimum monthly payment. The APR on the Average Daily Balance of purchases obtained after the last day of the promotional period and on the Average Daily Balance of cash advances will decrease if there is a decrease in the Index Rate."
6,9,"How We Will Calculate Your Balance We use a method called “average daily balance (including new transactions).” We figure the interest charge on your account by multiplying the applicable daily periodic rate by the “Average Daily Balance” of purchases and “Average Daily Balance” of cash advances and then multiplying the products by the number of days in the billing cycle. To get the “Average Daily Balance” of purchases, we start with the beginning balance of purchases on your account each day, including billed and unpaid interest charges related to purchases, and add any new purchases and other debit adjustments and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. At the end of each day, we multiply the daily balance by the daily periodic rate. The result is then added to the daily balance to determine the next day’s beginning balance. If the daily balance is negative, then it is considered to be zero. At the end of the statement period, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle to get the “Average Daily Balance” of purchases. To get the “Average Daily Balance” of cash advances, we start with the beginning balance of cash advances on your account each day, including billed and unpaid interest charges related to cash advances, and add any new advances and other debit adjustments and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. At the end of each day, we multiply the daily balance by the daily periodic rate. The result is then added to the daily balance to determine the next day’s beginning balance. If the daily balance is negative, then it is considered to be zero. At the end of the statement period, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide by the total number of days in the billing cycle to get the “Average Daily Balance” of cash advances."

7,2,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
7,3,"You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower."

7,6,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
7,7,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $20.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full."
7,8,"If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month if Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
7,9,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on new purchases on the first day of the following billing cycle. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
7,10,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type (excluding new purchases), and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
7,11,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. An International Assessment (ISA) fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
7,13,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available.

8,6,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
8,7,"3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give Us a reasonable opportunity to act on Your request. In addition, Your request must Page 2 of 6 02107558-MXC30-C-1-030421 (MXC303-E) accurately describe the check including the exact Account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, You may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless You confirm Your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify You when a stop payment order expires. If We re-credit Your Account after paying a check over a valid and timely stop payment order, You agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to Us all of Your rights against the payee or other holders of the check and to assist Us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold Us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to Our honoring Your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to Us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. Note: A convenience check is not a check as that term is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code. It is an advance from Your credit card Account with Us and Your stop payment rights are provided under this Agreement with Us."
8,8,"4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 1.00% of Your total New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater, plus any outstanding unpaid fees and charges, all prior unpaid payments, and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $10.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
8,9,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
8,10,"6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
8,11,"7. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Mastercard from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Mastercard itself receives or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that You complete or a merchant Page 3 of 6 02107558-MXC30-C-1-030421 (MXC303-E) completes on Your Card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
8,12,"8. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
8,13,"9. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
8,14,"10. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
8,15,"11. DEFAULT — You will be in default under this Agreement if You fail to pay the Minimum Payment Due by its Payment Due Date; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored or that We must return because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit that is returned unpaid; make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; file for bankruptcy; or die. You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement You have with Us. If You default, We may close Your Account and require You to pay any unpaid balance immediately, subject to applicable law. In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account."
8,16,"12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at PO Box 795, Traverse City, MI, 49685 or call Us at (800) 765-0110 or (844) 269-3009, seven days a week 24 hours a day.

However, if You exercise reasonable care in safeguarding Your Card from risk of loss or theft and, upon discovering the loss or theft promptly report the loss or theft to Us, You will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions. In any case, Your liability for unauthorized transactions will not exceed $50"

Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law.

You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security"

We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
9,36,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
9,37,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
9,38,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement"
9,39,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
9,40,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day.

If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
9,43,"10.

You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement You have with Us.

11,1,"VISA® CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT In this Agreement the words “you” and “your” mean each and all of those who agree to be bound by this Agreement; “Card” means the VISA credit card and any duplicates, renewals, or substitutions the Credit Union issues to you; “Account” means your VISA credit card line of credit account with the Credit Union, and “Credit Union” and “we” means the Credit Union whose name appears on this Agreement or anyone to whom the Credit Union transfers this Agreement. This Agreement becomes effective once you are approved for an account. You agree to its terms by using your account."
11,2,"1. Using Your Account. If you are approved for an Account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you and notify you of your credit limit. You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus “other charges”) that you will have outstanding on your Account at any time. If you are over your credit limit, you must pay the amount you are over before payments will begin to restore your credit limit. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union has the right to reduce your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your Account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law."
11,3,"2. Using Your Card. You may use your Card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept VISA Cards. However, you may not use your Card to initiate any type of electronic gambling transaction through the Internet. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union and from other financial institutions that accept VISA Cards, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept VISA Cards.) To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the Personal Identification Number (PIN). You can activate your card and set your PIN by calling the telephone number on the sticker on the front of your card. You agree that you will not use your Card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state or local law."
11,4,"3. Responsibility. You agree to pay all charges (purchases and cash advances) to your Account that are made by you or anyone whom you authorize to use your Account. You also agree to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your Account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint Account, Section 17 below also applies to your Account."
11,5,"4. Finance Charges. New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle or you paid the entire New Balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid any additional finance charges on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire New Balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement, unless there was also cash advance transaction (which includes balance transfers and convenience check transactions) within the same statement cycle, in which case the grace period ends. Finance charges begin to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance, there is no grace period. Finance charges will also begin to accrue immediately on all balances including purchases when a cash advance transaction (including balance transfers and convenience check transactions) is performed during the statement cycle."
11,6,"a. All VISA Credit Card Accounts as of December 1, 2009 have variable interest rates. The Annual Percentage Rate or APR, which is a variable rate will be effective and changed semi-annually on the 1st of November and the 1st of May and is determined by adding the margin assigned to your account to the Index. The Index is the Prime Rate (currently at 3.50%) as published in the Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the calendar month immediately preceding the change date as previously described. For example, the index rate published on the first business day of October plus the margin assigned to your Account will determine the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE or APR that will apply during the billing cycles that begin in November and continue until the next semi-annual change. The index published on the first business day of April plus the margin assigned to your Account will determine the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE or APR that will apply during the billing cycles that begin in May and will continue until the next semi-annual change. 1. VISA Credit Card Accounts opened prior to June 15, 2016; before you became obligated the Credit Union disclosed to you whether your Account was Classic or Platinum, the margin that is assigned to your account, along with the current variable ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE or APR and corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate. The margin assigned to your Account is 9% for Platinum cards and 10% for Classic cards. The floor on the APR will be equal to the margin for each type of card, in other words the APR on the Platinum card can never be lower than 9% and can never be lower than 10% for the Classic card. In no event will the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE applicable to your Account exceed 18%. The ANNUAL PRECENTAGE RATE or APR is the same for Cash Advance and Balance Transfers. 2. VISA Secured Classic Credit Card Accounts opened on or after June 15, 2016; before you became obligated the Credit Union disclosed to you the margin that is assigned to your account, along with the current variable ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE or APR and corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate. The margin assigned to your Account is 10%. The floor limit on the APR can never be lower than 10%. In no event will the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE applicable to your Account exceed 18%. The ANNUAL PRECENTAGE RATE or APR is the same for Cash Advance and Balance Transfers. 3. VISA Platinum Credit Card Accounts opened on or after June 15, 2016; your ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE or APR will be based upon your credit history and credit score, and determined by adding the margin of 6.45%, 8.45%, 10.45%, 12.45%, or 14.45% to the Prime Rate. The floor on the APR will be equal to the margin. In no event will the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE applicable to your Account exceed 18%. The ANNUAL PRECENTAGE RATE or APR is the same for Cash Advance and Balance Transfers."
11,7,"The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the monthly periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. The monthly periodic rates and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES will be disclosed on the Visa Credit Card Rate & Fee Disclosure on our Visa application. This Disclosure is available in paper form at any branch or via e-mail, or in electronic form at www.360fcu.org."
11,8,"5. Other Charges. The following other charges (fees) will be added to your Account see the Visa Credit Card Rate & Fee Disclosure, as applicable: a. Over the Credit Limit Fee: You may be charged a fee on a statement date if your New Balance on that date, less any fees imposed during the cycle, is over your credit limit. You may be charged the fee each subsequent month until your New Balance on the statement date, less any fees imposed during the cycle, is below your credit limit but will not exceed two additional consecutive billing cycles for a total of three billing cycle unless another transaction is made which is over the limit. You will only be charged this fee if you have signed up for the Credit Limit Protection program and have given us permission to bring your account over the limit. b. Late Payment Fee: A late charge will be added to your account if you are late in making a payment. c. Returned Payment Fee: If a check, share draft or other form of payment such as ACH or electronic transfer, used to make a payment on your account is returned unpaid, you will be charged a fee for each item returned. d.

Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement or no later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date, whichever is later. If your statement says the payment is “Now Due,” your payment is due no later than twenty-five (25) days from the statement closing date. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the Total New Balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2% of your Total New Balance, or $15.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, and any amount you are over your credit limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. All payments must be made in U.S. currency"
11,10,"7. Payment Allocation. Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses."
11,11,"8. Security Interest. To secure your VISA card account, you grant the Credit Union a purchase money security agreement interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in any goods you purchase through the account. If you default, we will have the right to recover any of these goods which have not been paid for. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. In addition, your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union now or in the future may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement."
11,12,"9. Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe. When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full Account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges, at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your Account may be applied towards what you owe."
11,13,"10. Liability for Unauthorized Use-Lost/Stolen Card Notification. You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing to Card Services, P.O. Box 3112, Tampa, FL 33631- 3112 or telephone (800) 449-7728 twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Credit Card.

11,14,"11. Changing or Terminating Your Account. The Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change may or may not apply to your existing Account balance as well as to future transactions. Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the Account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your Account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. The Card or Cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all Cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union.

If this is a joint Account, Section 17 of this Agreement also applies to termination of the Account."
11,15,"12. Credit Review and Release of Information. You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your Account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your Account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing.

11,16,"13. Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor your Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your Account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months."
11,17,"14. Additional Benefits/Card Enhancements. The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your Account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you.

11,18,"15. Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing rate. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee of 1% of the amount of the transaction, calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the U.S., Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands."
11,19,"16. Merchant Disputes. The Credit Union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your Card.

To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3.

13,2,"1. Responsibility: If we issue a card, you agree to repay all amounts advanced to you, any fees or charges and the FINANCE CHARGE arising from the use of the card and the card account. For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, your spouse and minor children and anyone else to whom you give the card. You may request additional cards for individuals you designate as authorized users. You are responsible to repay all amounts advanced by authorized users, any fees or charges and the FINANCE CHARGE arising from their use of the card.

You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but we will close the account for new transactions if you so request.

You agree not to let the account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment you make on the account will restore your Credit Line by the amount of the payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in your Credit Line by written application, or telephone call to us at 1-800-225-2555, which must be approved by us. By giving you written notice, we may reduce your Credit Line from time to time, or, with good cause, revoke your card and terminate this Agreement.

Good cause includes your failure to comply with this Agreement, our adverse reevaluation of your creditworthiness or your use of this card in furtherance of any purpose deemed to be illegal under state or federal law. You may also terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by either of us does not affect your obligation to pay the account balance and FINANCE CHARGE arising from authorized use of the card.

Such credit advances are considered by us as cash advances and are subject to the terms and conditions concerning cash advances in this Agreement"
13,8,"6. Credit Information: You authorize us to investigate your credit standing including your ability to pay, obtain and verify credit reports and other information about you when opening, renewing or reviewing your account, and you authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing, subject to applicable law. You agree that we will give information about the Account to credit reporting agencies. We will tell a credit reporting agency if you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement. This may have a negative impact on your credit report."
13,9,"7. Monthly Payment: We will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balances of purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and earned cash back awards; the current transactions on your account; the remaining credit available under the Credit Line; the New Balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers; the New Balance Total; the FINANCE CHARGE due to date; any other billed fees; and the Minimum Payment required. Each month, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may authorize us to charge the Minimum Payment automatically to your share account with us. You may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. The Minimum Payment on your account will be either (a) 2.0% of your Total New Balance, or $25, whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your Total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess without our demand. Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate."
13,10,"8. Irregular Payments: We can accept late payments, partial payments, checks and money orders marked “paid in full” or language having the same effect without losing any of our rights under this agreement."
13,11,"9. Finance Charge: You can avoid the FINANCE CHARGE on purchases by paying the full amount of the New Balance Total each month within 25 days of your statement closing date. Otherwise, the New Balance, including purchases, cash advances, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to your account, will be subject to the FINANCE CHARGE. Cash advances, balance transfers, convenience checks are always subject to the FINANCE CHARGE from the date they are posted to your account. The FINANCE CHARGE (interest) is calculated on the average daily principal balances of purchases and cash advances in the account at the daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate disclosed in the Cash Back Visa Credit Card Approval Letter. The principal balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers are determined each day during the statement period, beginning with the principal"
13,12,"10. Variable APR Based on Prime: Your Annual Percentage Rate is based on the U.S. Prime Rate (“Prime Rate”). Your Annual Percentage Rate will equal the Prime Rate plus a margin. If the Prime Rate increases, it will cause the Annual Percentage Rate to increase. If the Prime Rate decreases, it will cause the Annual Percentage Rate to decrease. Your FINANCE CHARGE for every $1.00 in your daily balance may increase if the Prime Rate rises and will decrease if the Prime Rate falls. For example, a change in the Prime Rate of one percentage point will result in a one percentage point change in the same direction in your Annual Percentage Rate with a corresponding change in your daily periodic rate. For each billing period, we use the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of each month. If the Prime Rate causes an Annual Percentage Rate to change, we put the new Annual Percentage Rate into effect as of the first day of the billing period following the month in which the Prime Rate changed. We apply the new Annual Percentage Rate to any existing balance, subject to any promotional rates that may apply"
13,13,"The Cash Back Visa margin is determined based on an evaluation of each member’s credit history. The margin will range from 7.99% to 14.24%. The Annual Percentage Rate will not increase to more than 18% (or such other rates as may be permitted under the Federal Credit Union Act). Your Annual Percentage Rate may also change in the event that you request and are approved for an increase or decrease in your Credit Line or request and are approved to change your credit product. 11. Military Lending Act: Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: the costs associated with credit insurance premiums or debt protection fees; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).

If you request photocopies of sales slips, duplicate copies of monthly billing statements or a replacement card, you agree to pay our reasonable costs for such services. The present charges for these services are stated specifically in the current Service Price List. You can pick one up in any branch or call us and we’ll mail a copy to you"

You will also be in default if: (a) you breach any other conditions of the Agreement; (b) bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are started by you or against you; (c) if we determine your creditworthiness (which includes your ability to repay us) has become unsatisfactory due to change in employment, increase in your other obligations, or because of any other reason; (d) in the event of your death; (e) your use of the card in furtherance of any purpose deemed to be illegal under state or"

If the penalty APR is applied to your account, it will apply to both existing and new transactions. It will no longer apply to existing transactions if you make the next six consecutive minimum payments. If you do not make these six consecutive minimum payments, the Penalty APR may continue to apply to both new and existing balances indefinitely."
13,18,"15. Using the Card: You must sign your card to use it. To make a purchase or cash advance, there are two alternative procedures to follow. One is for you to present the card to a participating Visa plan merchant, to us or to another financial institution. You may be required to sign the sales or cash advance draft. The other is to complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the card in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the Visa system. ATM transactions are subject to cash advance fees. The monthly statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. You should retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify the monthly statement. The Credit Union may make a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request. We may issue Cash Back Visa Convenience Checks to you which may be used to obtain cash advances. Each Convenience Check will contain your Credit Union member number and may be used only by the person whose name is printed on it. Each must be completed and signed in the same way as a regular personal check. You may not use a Cash Back Visa Convenience Check to pay any amount owed to us on this credit card agreement or any other APGFCU credit card or loans you may have with us. If you give your account number to make a purchase or obtain a cash advance without presenting the card (such as for online, mail order or telephone purchase), the legal effect will still be the same as if the card itself was used by you. We are not responsible if anyone refuses to honor your credit card or Convenience"
13,19,"16. Prohibited Use of the Card: You may not use your card to buy lottery tickets, place bets or gamble if these transactions are made online. You also may not use your card for any illegal transactions."
13,20,"17. Stop Payment: If before a Balance Transfer or Convenience Check drawn on your Account has been honored, you notify us not to pay it, we will stop payment on the check. You must send us a written and signed stop payment order which states the number, payee, amount, and date of the check on which payment is to be stopped. We may disregard any such order six months after our receipt unless you renew your request"
13,21,"18. Returns and Adjustments: Merchants and others who honor the card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or refund it and transfer the credit balance to your share account"
13,22,"19. Foreign Transactions: Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The conversion rate to dollars and the fees for all international transactions will be in accordance with the operating regulations of Visa USA, Inc. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable processing date. In addition, a fee of 1% of the transaction amount may be charged on all international transactions regardless of whether or not currency conversion is involved."
13,23,"20. Plan Merchant Disputes: We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your card. We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home. Any other disputes you must resolve directly with the plan merchant."
13,24,"21. Effect of Agreement: This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions of your account even though the sales, cash advance, balance transfer or convenience checks you sign may contain different terms. We may amend this Agreement from time to time by sending you advance written notice required by law. The Amendment will become effective on the effective date stated in the notice. Use of your card after receiving notice of a change will further evidence your agreement to the change. If you give us written notice that you do not agree to the change, we will terminate your account and you will be permitted to pay the outstanding balance as of the effective date under the terms of the Agreement governing your account at the time our notice was given. If you use your card after the effective date of this Agreement or any Amendment, you will be considered to have agreed to the new terms even if you have sent us such written notice. To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our notice, amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as future transactions"
13,25,"22. Notices: We mail you statements and notices through the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, and address them to you at the latest billing address on our records or, if you’ve agreed, by email to the address you gave us. Any notice that we send you through the U.S. Mail is deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. Mail. We consider an electronic notice sent as soon as we email it, unless we receive notification that the email was undeliverable. You must notify us immediately if you change the address to which we send billing statements. If you have more than one account you must notify us and we will change the address on all accounts. We may update your billing address if we receive information that it has changed or is incorrect."

We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.

If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

To use this right, all of the following must be true: • The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) • You must have used your credit card for the purchase.

14,8,"4c. Balance Transfers: Balance transfers are a feature of your card, which you may access anytime or during promotions we may offer from time to time. You may transfer balances from other creditors up to your available credit limit. Balances you transfer from other creditors will be treated as cash advances for the purpose of this agreement and will be subject to your standard cash advance APR unless a promotional APR applies.

You agree that we will give information about the Account to credit reporting agencies. We will tell a credit reporting agency if you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement. This may have a negative impact on your credit report."
14,11,"7. Monthly Payment: We will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers; the current transactions on your account; the remaining credit available under the Credit Line; the New Balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers; the New Balance Total; the FINANCE CHARGE due to date; any other billed fees; and the Minimum Payment required. Each month, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may authorize us to charge the Minimum Payment automatically to your share account with us. You may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. The Minimum Payment on your account will be either (a) 2.0% of your Total New Balance, or $25, whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your Total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess without our demand. Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate"
14,12,"8. Irregular Payments: We can accept late payments, partial payments, checks and money orders marked “paid in full” or language having the same effect without losing any of our rights under this agreement."
14,13,"9. Finance Charge: You can avoid the FINANCE CHARGE on purchases by paying the full amount of the New Balance Total each month within 25 days of your statement closing date. Otherwise, the New Balance, including purchases, cash advances, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to your account, will be subject to the FINANCE CHARGE. Cash advances, balance transfers, convenience checks are always subject to the FINANCE CHARGE from the date they are posted to your account. The FINANCE CHARGE (interest) is calculated on the average daily principal balances of purchases and cash advances in the account at the daily periodic rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate disclosed in the VISA Credit Card Approval Letter. The principal balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers are determined each day during the statement period, beginning with the principal portion of your Previous Balances, reduced by payments you make and credits we apply, and increased by purchases, cash advances and balance transfers you make and debit adjustments we make during the statement period. The daily principal balances are totaled and divided by the number of days in the statement period, to produce separate average daily principal balances for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers to which the periodic rate is then applied."
14,14,"10a. Non-Variable Rate APR: Your Annual Percentage rate is provided in your VISA Credit Card Approval Letter (the “stated rate”). This rate is subject to change. We may modify this rate only after providing you with written notice at least forty five (45) days in advance. Any change in these terms, including changes in the Annual Percentage Rate, will apply to your future transactions. Your Annual Percentage Rate may also change in the event that you request and are approved for an increase or decrease in your Credit Line or request and are approved to change your credit product."
14,15,"10b. Variable APRs Based on Prime: For our variable rate cards, your Annual Percentage Rate is based on the U.S. Prime Rate (“Prime Rate”). Your Annual Percentage Rate will equal the Prime Rate plus a margin. If the Prime Rate increases, it will cause the Annual Percentage Rate to increase. If the Prime Rate decreases, it will cause the Annual Percentage Rate to decrease. Your FINANCE CHARGE for every $1.00 in your daily balance may increase if the Prime Rate rises and will decrease if the Prime Rate falls. For example, a change in the Prime Rate of one percentage point will result in a one percentage point change in the same direction in your Annual Percentage Rate with a corresponding change in your daily periodic rate. For each billing period, we use the Prime Rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of each month. If the Prime Rate causes an Annual Percentage Rate to change, we put the new Annual Percentage Rate into effect as of the first day of the billing period following the month in which the Prime Rate changed. We apply the new Annual Percentage Rate to any existing balance, subject to any promotional rates that may apply. For Platinum Preferred Student/Starter, Platinum Preferred and Platinum Preferred Rewards VISA cards, the margin is determined based on an evaluation of each member’s credit history. The margins will range from 5.74% to 14.24% based on product type. For the Classroom Supply VISA, the margin is 0.00%. For the Share Secured and the Money Market Share Secured VISA cards, the margin is 1.00%. If your VISA credit line is secured by a Regular Share account, the maximum rate will not exceed 5% above the current APGFCU dividend rate on Regular Share Accounts. If your VISA credit line is secured by a Money Market Share Account, the maximum rate will not exceed 5% above the current APGFCU tier for the lowest Money Market tier rate. For all other variable rate cards, The Annual Percentage Rate will not increase to more than 18% (or such other rates as may be permitted under the Federal Credit Union Act). Your Annual Percentage Rate may also change in the event that you request and are approved for an increase or decrease in your Credit Line or request and are approved to change your credit product"
14,16,"11. Military Lending Act: Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: the costs associated with credit insurance premiums or debt protection fees; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account). To receive this notice verbally, please call 800-225-2555 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Certain contractual provisions, as more fully set forth in 32 C.F.R. Section 232.8, are not permitted in loan agreements with borrowers covered by the Military Lending Act (MLA). To the extent that any of those provisions are contained in these disclosures, they shall be inapplicable to covered borrowers under the MLA."
14,17,"12. Late Charge: If you fail to pay the minimum on your account within fifteen (15) days of the payment due date, a late payment charge will be assessed and added to your account"
14,18,"13. Fees: The VISA Card account shall be subject to service charges in accordance with the rate schedules disclosed in the VISA Credit Card Application, VISA Credit Approval Letter, and/or VISA Credit Card Disclosure Statement and Agreement. If you request photocopies of sales slips, duplicate copies of monthly billing statements or a replacement card, you agree to pay our reasonable costs for such services. The present charges for these services are stated specifically in the current Service Price List. You can pick one up in any branch or call us and we’ll mail a copy to you."
14,19,"14a. Default and Share Secured Default: You will be in default if you fail to make the minimum payment within 25 days after your monthly statement closing date. You will also be in default if: (a) you breach any other conditions of the Agreement; (b) bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are started by you or against you; (c) if we determine your credit-worthiness (which includes your ability to repay us) has become unsatisfactory due to change in employment, increase in your other obligations, or because of any other reason; (d) in the event of your death; (e) your use of the card in furtherance of any purpose deemed to be illegal under state or federal law; or (f) we discover at any time that you provided false or fraudulent information in your credit application.

One is for you to present the card to a participating VISA plan merchant, to us or to another financial institution. You may be required to sign the sales or cash advance draft. The other is to complete the transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the card in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the VISA system.

Each must be completed and signed in the same way as a regular personal check. You may not use a VISA Convenience Check to pay any amount owed to us on this credit card agreement or any other APGFCU credit card or loans you may have with us. If you give your account number to make a purchase or obtain a cash advance without presenting the card (such as for online, mail order or telephone purchase), the legal effect will still be the same as if the card itself was used by you. We are not responsible if anyone refuses to honor your credit card or Convenience Check"

Returns and Adjustments: Merchants and others who honor the card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or refund it and transfer the credit balance to your share account"
14,26,"19. Foreign Transactions: Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The conversion rate to dollars and the fees for all international transactions will be in accordance with the operating regulations of VISA USA, Inc. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives, or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable processing date. In addition, a fee of 1% of the transaction amount may be charged on all international transactions regardless of whether or not currency conversion is involved."

We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home. Any other disputes you must resolve directly with the plan merchant"

Effect of Agreement: This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions of your account even though the sales, cash advance, balance transfer or convenience checks you sign may contain different terms. We may amend this Agreement from time to time by sending you advance written notice required by law. The Amendment will become effective on the effective date stated in the notice. Use of your card after receiving notice of a change will further evidence your agreement to the change. If you give us written notice that you do not agree to the change, we will terminate your account and you will be permitted to pay the outstanding balance as of the effective"
14,29,"If you use your card after the effective date of this Agreement or any Amendment, you will be considered to have agreed to the new terms even if you have sent us such written notice. To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our notice, amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as future transactions."
14,30,"22. Notices: We mail you statements and notices through the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, and address them to you at the latest billing address on our records or, if you've agreed, by email to the address you gave us. Any notice that we send you through the U.S. Mail is deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. Mail. We consider an electronic notice sent as soon as we email it, unless we receive notification that the email was undeliverable. You must notify us immediately if you change the address to which we send billing statements. If you have more than one account you must notify us and we will change the address on all accounts.

Your participation in such a rewards program is subject to the particular rewards program’s terms and conditions (the “Program Rules”). Your use of the card associated with the rewards program is your consent to be bound by the Program Rules. The Program Rules may, from time to time, be modified or amended, including but not limited to discontinuing particular rewards or discontinuing the rewards program itself. The latest edition of Program Rules will typically be provided with the associated Card or otherwise made available to you, for example, by visiting a particular internet address. We will provide a copy of such Program Rules upon request. If you close your account and/or membership, you will forfeit all rewards points earned but not yet credited.

We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.

If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

We will determine whether an error occurred within ten (10) business days (20 business days if the transfer involved a new account) after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days (90 days if the transfer involved a new account, or a foreign initiated transfer) to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 5 business days (20 days if the transfer involved a new account) for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
16,8,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases and balance transfers on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases or balance transfers if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of Your Account, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."

Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees.

The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $35.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $35.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance.

The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

To get the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, balance transfers or other advances, and subtract any payments, unpaid interest charges, and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide that by the number of days in the billing cycle.

If you have different rates for purchases, cash advances or balance transfers, separate average daily balances for each will be calculated and the appropriate periodic rate is then applied to each."

We may change the terms of this Agreement, including the method of calculating the periodic rate, at any time, by written notice, subject to applicable law. Use of the Card constitutes agreement and acceptance of any change in terms, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

You agree not to use Your Card for illegal transactions including, but not limited to, advances made for the purpose of gambling and/or wagering where such practices are in violation of applicable state and/or federal law. SECURITY. Collateral (other than household goods or any dwelling) given as security under any other loan You may have with Us will secure all amounts You owe Us now and in the future if that status is reflected in the ""Truth-in-Lending Disclosure"" in any particular Agreement evidencing such debt. CONSENSUAL LIEN ON SHARES. You grant and consent to a lien on Your shares with Us (except for IRA and Keogh accounts) and any dividends due or to become due to You from Us to the extent You owe on any unpaid Credit Card balance. ACCOUNT RESTRICTIONS. In order to receive and maintain a VISA Secured or MasterCard Secured Credit Card, You agree to give Us a specific pledge of shares which will be equal to the sum total of Your Credit Limit, plus the greater of: (a) $100.00; or (b) 10% of such Credit Limit. In the event that You default on Your Account, We may apply these shares toward the repayment of any amount owed on Your VISA Secured or MasterCard Secured Credit Card. You may cancel Your VISA Secured or MasterCard Secured Credit Card at any time by paying any amounts owed on such Account. To be certain that Your entire balance and all advances are paid, any shares pledged may not be available to You for 30 days after You have cancelled and any outstanding balance is paid in full. LINE OF CREDIT LIMITS. You will be notified of each specific Credit Limit for which You are approved. Unless You are in default, the Credit Limits established for You will generally be self-replenishing as You make payments. You will keep Your unpaid balance within Your Credit Limit set by Us, and You will pay any amount over Your Credit Limit on Our demand whether or not We authorize the advances which caused You to exceed Your Credit Limit. Even if Your unpaid balance is less than Your Credit Limit, You will have no credit available during any time that any aspect of Your Account is in default. JOINT ACCOUNTS. Each Borrower will be responsible, jointly and severally, for the repayment of any amounts owed. If any Account access device, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN) is requested and approved, You understand that any such Account access device(s) will be mailed only to the primary Borrower at the address that We have on file for You. We may refuse to follow any instructions which run counter to this provision. MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENTS (PAYMENT SCHEDULE). Though You need only pay the Minimum Monthly Payments, You understand that You have the right to repay at any time without penalty. You also understand that You will only be charged periodic Finance Charges to the date You repay Your entire balance. You may make larger payments without penalty. Any partial payment or prepayment will not delay Your next scheduled payment. All payments to Us must be in lawful money of the United States. We may apply each payment to"
21,14,"any delay in the repayment of Your unpaid balance will increase Your periodic Finance Charges and any acceleration in the repayment of Your unpaid balance will decrease Your periodic Finance Charges. Minimum Payments will be an amount equal to 3.00% of Your new unpaid Account balance at the end of each billing cycle, subject to the lesser of $25.00 or Your balance, plus any portion of the Minimum Payments shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid, plus any amount that exceeds Your approved Credit Limit. You may, by separate agreement, authorize Us to charge Your payment directly to Your share or share draft account. FINANCE CHARGES. In the case of any transactions under Your Account, the balances subject to the periodic Finance Charge are the average daily transactions balances outstanding during the month (including new transactions). To get the average daily balance, We take the beginning balance of Your Account each day, add any new purchases, balance transfers, cash advances, insurance premiums, debit adjustments or other charges and subtract any payments, credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives Us the daily balance. Then, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Finance Charge for a billing cycle is computed by multiplying the average daily balance subject to a Finance Charge by the Daily Periodic Rate times the number of days in the billing cycle. You can avoid Finance Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the entire balance owed each month within 25 days of Your statement closing date. Otherwise, the new balance of purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to Your Account, will be subject to a Finance Charge. Balance transfers and cash advances are always subject to a Finance Charge from the later of the date they are posted to Your Account or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account. LATE CHARGE. If Your payment is 10 or more days late, You will be charged the lesser of: (a) $15.00 for balances that are less than $100.00, $20.00 for balances equal to or greater than $100.00 but less than $1,000.00, or $25.00 for balances equal to or greater than $1,000.00; or (b) the amount of the minimum payment due. VISA FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. For transactions initiated in foreign countries and foreign currencies, the exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency (U.S. dollars) will be: (a) a rate selected by VISA from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate VISA itself receives; or (b) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. For transactions that are initiated in a foreign currency, You will be charged 1.00% of the final settlement amount. For transactions occurring in foreign"
21,15,"countries and initiated in U.S. Dollars, You will be charged 0.80% of the final settlement amount. MASTERCARD FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. For transactions initiated in foreign currencies, the exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency (U.S. dollars) will be: (a) a rate selected by MasterCard from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate MasterCard itself receives; or (b) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. In each instance You will be charged 8/10th of 1.00% calculated on the final settlement amount for transactions that are initiated in foreign countries, and if your transaction is also initiated in a foreign currency You will be charged an additional 2/10th of 1.00% calculated on the final converted settlement amount. OTHER FEES AND CHARGES. You will be charged the following fees associated with the use of Your Card: (a) the lesser of $15.00 or the required minimum payment amount for the returned payment for any check (or other negotiable instrument used for payment) which is returned unpaid; and (b) $5.00 for each replacement Card You request. PERIODIC STATEMENTS. On a regular basis, You will receive a statement showing all transactions on Your Account including amounts paid and borrowed since Your last statement. We will mail You a statement each month in which there is a debit or credit balance or when a Finance Charge is imposed. We need not send You a statement if We feel Your Account is uncollectible or if We have started collection proceedings against You because You defaulted. EACH STATEMENT IS DEEMED TO BE A CORRECT STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU ESTABLISH A BILLING ERROR PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL TRUTH-IN-LENDING ACT. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO HONOR CONVENIENCE CHECKS. We are under no obligation to honor Your Convenience Checks if: (1) by paying a Convenience Check, You would exceed Your Credit Limit; (2) Your Cards or Convenience Checks have been reported lost or stolen; (3) Your Account has been cancelled or has expired. If a postdated Convenience Check is paid and, as a result, any other Convenience Check is returned unpaid, We are not responsible for any resulting loss or liability. DEFAULT. You will be in default if: (a) You do not make any payment or perform any obligation under this Agreement, or any other agreement that You may have with Us; or (b) You should die, become involved in any insolvency, receivership or custodial proceeding brought by or against You; or (c) You have made a false or misleading statement in Your credit application and/or in Your representations to Us while You owe money on Your Account; or (d) A judgment or tax lien should be filed against You or any attachment or garnishment should be issued against any of Your property or rights, specifically including anyone starting an action or proceeding to seize any of Your funds on deposit with Us; and/or (e) We should, in good faith, believe Your ability to repay Your indebtedness hereunder is or soon will be impaired, time being of the very essence. Upon any occurrence of default, We may, to the extent permitted by law, cancel Your rights under this Agreement, require the return of all access devices and declare the entire balance of every Feature Category of Your Account immediately due and payable, without prior notice or demand. COLLECTION COSTS. In the event collection efforts are required to obtain payment on this Account, to the extent permitted by law, You agree to pay all court costs, private process server fees, investigation fees or other costs incurred in collection and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in the course of collecting any amounts owed under this Agreement or in the recovery of any Collateral. ENFORCEMENT. We do not lose Our rights under this or any related agreement if We delay enforcing them. We can accept late payments, partial payments or any other payments, even if they are marked ""paid in full"" without losing any of Our rights under this Agreement. If any provision of this or any related agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, all other provisions remain in full force and effect. NOTIFICATION OF ADDRESS CHANGE. You will notify Us promptly if You move or otherwise have a change of address. CHANGE IN TERMS. We may change the terms of this Agreement by mailing or delivering to You written notice of the changes as prescribed by the Federal TruthIn-Lending Act. To the extent permitted by law, the right to change the terms of this Agreement includes, but is not limited to, the right to change the periodic rate applicable to Your unpaid balance and/or future advances.

However, You may purchase any credit insurance available through Us and have the premiums added to Your outstanding balance.

This PIN is confidential and should not be disclosed to anyone. You may use Your PIN to access Your Account and all sums advanced will be added to Your Account balance. In the event a use of Your PIN constitutes an Electronic Fund Transfer, the terms and conditions of Your Electronic Fund Transfer Agreement may also affect Your rights. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT. Even though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips You may sign or receive when using Your Card contain terms, this Agreement is the contract which solely applies to all transactions involving the Card. UNAUTHORIZED USE. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of Your Card. You will not be liable for the unauthorized use that occurs after You notify Us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use by calling Us at (800) 442-4257 or by writing to Us at P.O. Box 815909, Dallas, TX 75381-5909. In any case, Your liability will not exceed $50.00. REFUSAL TO HONOR CARDS OR CONVENIENCE CHECKS. We are not liable for the refusal or inability of merchants, financial institutions and others to accept the Cards or Convenience Checks, or electronic terminals to honor the Cards or complete a Card withdrawal, or for their retention of the Cards or Convenience Checks. TRANSACTION SLIPS. Your monthly statement will identify that merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advances, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. LOST CARDS OR CONVENIENCE CHECKS. To report lost or stolen Credit Cards or Convenience Checks, You will immediately call Us at (800) 442-4257 or write to Us at P.O. Box 815909, Dallas, TX 75381-5909. CREDITS. If a merchant who honors Your Card gives You credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by sending Us a slip which will be posted to Your Account. If Your credits and payments exceed what You owe Us, We will hold and apply this credit against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is $1.00 or more refund it on Your written request or automatically deposit it to Your share account after 6 months.

Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use This notice tells You about Your rights and Our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If You think there is an error on Your statement, write to Us at Our address shown in this Agreement. In Your letter, give us the following information:"
21,17,"Account information: Your name and Account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If You think there is an error on Your bill, describe what You believe is wrong and why You believe it is a mistake. You must contact Us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on Your statement. • At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if You want to stop payment on the amount You think is wrong. You must notify Us of any potential errors in writing. You may call Us, but if You do We are not required to investigate any potential errors and You may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When We receive Your letter, We must do two things: 1) Within 30 days of receiving Your letter, We must tell You that We received Your letter. We will also tell You if We have already corrected the error. 2) Within 90 days of receiving Your letter, We must either correct the error or explain to You why We believe the bill is correct. While We investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report You as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on Your statement, and We may continue to charge You interest on that amount. • While You do not have to pay the amount in question, You are responsible for the remainder of Your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against Your Credit Limit. After We finish Our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If We made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount."
21,18,"If We do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send You a statement of the amount You owe and the date payment is due. We may then report You as delinquent if You do not pay the amount We think You owe. If You receive Our explanation but still believe Your bill is wrong, You must write to Us within 10 days telling Us that You still refuse to pay. If You do so, We cannot report You as delinquent without also reporting that You are questioning Your bill. We must tell You the name of anyone to whom we reported You as delinquent, and We must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between Us. If We do not follow all of the rules above, You do not have to pay the first $50.00 of the amount You question even if Your bill is correct. Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If You are dissatisfied with the goods or services that You have purchased with Your Credit Card, and You have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, You may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1) The purchase must have been made in Your home state or within 100 miles of Your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50.00. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if Your purchase was based on an advertisement We mailed to You, or if We own the company that sold You the goods or services.) 2) You must have used Your Credit Card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses Your Credit Card account do not qualify. 3) You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and You are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact Us in writing at Our address shown in this Agreement.

But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake, you will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.

22,15,"Method of Computing Finance Charges – We will begin charging interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to our account. We will begin charging you interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the later of the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to your Account. No Finance Charges will be imposed during any billing period where there is no balance owed at the beginning of the billing period or a credit balance exists. If you have a previous balance on your billing statement, we will apply Finance Charges on the “Total New Balance” (previous balance plus any fees, purchases, transfers and cash advances minus any payment(s) you made). The Finance Charges are determined by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate (MPR) of your Account to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance. Finance Charges for cash advances and transfers begins to accrue from the date they are originated or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advances or transfers are posted to your Account, whichever is later. Finance Charges on your purchases of goods and services start accruing on the day the transactions post to the Account. To compute the Monthly Periodic Rate, divide the APR by twelve. To compute the Average Daily Balance, we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, then add any new purchases, unpaid Finance Charges, fees, and other charges, then subtract any payments, credits or credit adjustments. This gives us the daily balance. We then add up all the daily balances for the term of the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance.” All transactions on your Account are calculated by this method even if calculated separately. Grace Period – “Grace Period” means the period of time during a billing cycle when you will not accrue Finance Charges on certain transactions or balance(s). To avoid Finance Charges on new purchases of goods and services and to take advantage of the Grace Period, you must have paid the New Balance from the prior month billing statement in full by the “Payment Due Date” and pay the “Total New Balance” of the current billing statement (showing all new transactions) in full by 5:00 PM on the “Payment Due Date.” A Grace Period does not apply to balance transfers and cash advances."
22,16,"When Your Payment will be Credited to Your Account – If you make your payment in person at one of our branches, your payment will be credited on the same day you make the transaction. Payments made electronically before 5:00 PM will be credited on the same day except for Sundays and Federal Holidays. Mailed payments will be credited as of the date they are received. If your “Payment Due Date” is a Sunday or Federal Holiday, you will not be considered late for any purpose and will not incur a late payment fee if your payment is made by the next business day that we are open. Current Payment Due– Each month you must pay at least the current payment shown on your statement by the “Payment Due Date” on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the new balance in full. If you make additional payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The “Current Payment Due” each month is the greater of $25.00 or 2% of the “New Balance” rounded up to the nearest dollar. The “Current Payment Due” must be received by 5:00 PM on the “Payment Due Date” which will be on the same date every month and no less than 25 days from the end of the prior billing statement closing date. Payment Allocation – You may pay more than the “Current Payment Due” and make payments to your Account at any time without penalty. If your “Total Outstanding"
22,17,"Balance” includes balances with different APRs, we will allocate funds you pay over the “Current Payment Due” to the balance with the highest APR first, and any remaining excess funds after that to the next highest APR in descending order. This will result in balances with higher APRs to be paid before any others. If your credits and payments exceed the total balance owed on the Account, your Account will show a credit balance and the funds will be applied against future purchases, transfers or cash advances. Partial payments will increase the total amount of interest you pay and will not delay your next scheduled payment. We may accept late payments and partial payments and such action shall not constitute forgiveness or a waiver of any terms under this Agreement. Where your credit and payment balance is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six (6) months. Skip-A-Payment – From time to time, solely at the Credit Union’s option, you may be given the option to skip-a-payment. If you elect to take advantage of the offer to skip-apayment, finance charges will continue to accrue during the month you choose to skipa-payment. You must resume paying the Current Payment Due on the next Payment Due Date. Any fee incurred may be considered a finance charge. All loans and this Account must be current and the membership must be in good standing to be eligible. A fee of $35 will be charged for each skip-a-payment."

Balance transfers may be subject to a temporary Promotional Rate as set forth in the Account Opening Disclosures, and will be subject to the Standard Rate Daily Periodic Rate and APR after any Promotional Rate period. If a temporary Promotional Rate does not apply, balance transfers will be subject to the Standard Rate Daily Periodic Rate and APR at all times, including during any Introductory Rate period for purchases."
24,11,"Cash advances, including balance transfers, incur an INTEREST CHARGE from the date they are posted to the Account. New purchases will not incur an INTEREST CHARGE on the date they are posted to the Account if you have paid the Account in full by the due date shown on your previous monthly statement or if there was no previous balance. No additional INTEREST CHARGE will be incurred whenever you pay the Account in full by the Payment Due Date. We calculate the periodic INTEREST CHARGE on your Account by applying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate to the Average Daily Balance of your Account for each feature category, including certain current transactions. Feature categories include purchases, balance transfers, cash advances and promotional balances.These calculations may combine different feature categories with the same Daily Periodic Rates.The Average Daily Balance for each feature category is arrived at by taking the beginning balance of each feature category each day and adding any new transactions to the balance, except we will not include new purchases if you have paid in full the New Balance on your previous statement by the Payment Due Date or if the New Balance on your previous statement was zero or reflected a credit balance.We then subtract any payments or credits and unpaid INTEREST CHARGES and FINANCE CHARGES allocated to the feature category balance for the day.This gives us the daily balance for such feature category. The daily balances for each feature category are then added together and divided by the number of days in the billing cycle.The result is the Average Daily Balance for each feature category.The periodic INTEREST CHARGE for each feature category is determined by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the number of days in the billing cycle and applying the applicable Daily Periodic Rate to the product."
24,12,"b. Grace Period and When INTEREST CHARGE Begins to Accrue – Credit purchases made during a billing cycle will not accrue a periodic rate portion of INTEREST CHARGES during that billing cycle if you have paid in full the entire “New Balance” shown on your most recent previous periodic statement by the “Payment Due Date” shown on such statement, or there was a zero or credit balance on your most recent previous periodic statement, and you pay the New Balance in full by the Payment Due Date shown on the current billing statement. The Payment Due Date will be at least 25 days from the date we send each periodic statement. Otherwise, the INTEREST CHARGE on credit purchases will begin to accrue on the date each credit purchase is posted to your Account.To avoid an additional periodic rate portion of INTEREST CHARGES being applied in the next billing cycle to current cycle credit purchases, you must pay in full the New Balance by the Payment Due Date shown on your periodic statement."
24,13,"c. Periodic Review of Creditworthiness and APR Adjustments – Except for Dinero Visa and Savings Secured Visa Accounts, the Standard Rate Daily Periodic Rate and corresponding APR for all advances is based on certain creditworthiness criteria.After your Account has been open for at least one year, we may review your creditworthiness from time to time, including when you request a credit limit increase, and adjust the Standard Rate Daily Periodic Rate and corresponding APR for all advances within the range set forth in the Account Opening Disclosures.

Increases in your Standard Rate APR will remain in effect for at least six months and may remain in effect indefinitely.Any increase in your Standard Rate APR will only apply to advances made after the effective date of the change.Advances made before the effective date of a Standard Rate APR increase will remain subject to the APR in effect before the date of the change."

28,2,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
28,3,"You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower."
28,4,"Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."

28,6,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
28,7,"3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give Us a reasonable opportunity to act on Your request.

If permitted, You may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless You confirm Your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify You when a stop payment order expires. If We re-credit Your Account after paying a check over a valid and timely stop payment order, You agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to Us all of Your rights against the payee or other holders of the check and to assist Us in any legal action.

Note: A convenience check is not a check as that term is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code. It is an advance from Your credit card Account with Us and Your stop payment rights are provided under this Agreement with Us."
28,8,"4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.50% of Your total New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $10.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
28,9,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of Your Account, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
28,10,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
28,11,"6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
28,12,"7. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
28,13,"8. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
28,14,"9. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume."
28,15,"0. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges"
28,16,"11. DEFAULT — You will be in default under this Agreement if You fail to pay the Minimum Payment Due by its Payment Due Date; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored or that We must return because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit that is returned unpaid; make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; file for bankruptcy; or die. You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement You have with Us. If You default, We may close Your Account and require You to pay any unpaid balance immediately, subject to applicable law. In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account."

31,7,"4. REPAYMENT - You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $10.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance.

If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance).

We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
31,8,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES - We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (""Transaction Type""). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding ""average daily balance."" To get the ""average daily balance"" for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the ""average daily balance"" for each Transaction Type."

The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

In addition to the Interest Charges set forth above, you agree to also pay any and all fees that you incur as disclosed to you on your Truth-inLending Statement or similar disclosures (as may be amended from time to time), or as disclosed to you during the term of your Card.

33,11,"Minimum Payment Due; Crediting of Payments. Payments are due in the amount and on the date disclosed on your billing statement. If your payment is received by us on a business day at the address and by the time designated on the billing statement, it will be credited to your account on the date of receipt.

We do not have to pay any item which would cause the outstanding balance in your account to exceed your credit limit. Credit Information.

Termination; Change-in-Terms. We may, by written notice, terminate this Agreement at any time, subject to applicable law. You may terminate this Agreement by written notice. Termination by either party shall not affect your obligation to repay any balance on your account resulting from use of the Card as well as Interest Charges and fees incurred.

Use of the Card constitutes agreement and acceptance of any change in terms, unless applicable law requires otherwise. Our failure to exercise any of our rights or to take any action shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, or an amendment or change in any of the terms of this Agreement"
33,15,"Late or Partial Payments. Any payment that delays the reduction of your balance will increase your total interest costs. Partial payments or prepayments will not delay your next scheduled payment - you will still need to make the minimum scheduled payment by the next scheduled due date to keep your account current. We may accept late payments, partial payments, checks or money orders marked ""payment in full"" and such action shall not constitute final settlement of your account or a waiver or forgiveness of any amounts owing under this Agreement. Enforcement. We do not lose our rights under this or any related agreement if we delay enforcing them. If any provision of this or any related agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, all other provisions remain in full force and effect. Returns and Adjustments.

If the credit balance amount is $1 or more, it will be refunded upon your written or verbal request. Plan Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your Card. Also, we are not responsible for goods or services that you purchase with the Card unless: (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated in sending you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or within 100 miles of your home; and only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant.

In your letter, give us the following information: Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. • • You must contact us: You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. 1. 2. • • • • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at the address(es) listed on your statement. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill.

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. • • After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 1. 2. 3. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: Your name and account number. The dollar amount of the suspected error.

You are also responsible for all charges made after the termination of Your account unless, they are unauthorized charges as described in this Agreement .The Cards remain Our property, and You must recover and surrender to Us all Cards upon Our request and upon termination of this Agreement. We have the right to demand payment immediately upon termination of the entire Balance owed if the account is terminated. We may change Your Credit Line from time to time. If You attempt a transaction which results in Your total outstanding balance (plus authorizations) exceeding Your Credit Line, We may: 1) permit the transaction without raising Your Credit Line; 2) permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is more than the Credit Line as immediately due; or 3) refuse to permit the transaction.

You acknowledge that You are at least 19 years of age, that You do not already have a MASTERCARD® Credit Card issued by Alabama Credit Union and have not applied for such an account within the past six months."
34,7,"5. Payments. Each month You must pay at least the Minimum Payment shown on Your statement by the date specified on the statement or no later than 25 days from the statement closing date, whichever is later. If Your statement says the payment is “Now Due,” Your payment is due no later than 25 days from the statement closing date. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment or pay the Total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Minimum Payment is 2.5% of Your Total New Balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, not to exceed Your Total New Balance, plus the amount of any prior Minimum Payments that You have not made, and any amount You are over Your Credit Line or Credit Limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which You are over Your Credit Line or Credit Limit. Subject to applicable law, Your payments may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses; currently, We apply payments first to Interest Charges, then to fees, then to Minimum Payment for cash advances, then to Minimum Payment for purchases, then to the balance of cash advances, then to the balance of credit purchases. If a payment is ever late 10 days or more, You agree to pay Us a late charge of $20.00. If You make a payment by check or other item which for any reason is dishonored You agree to pay a fee of $20.00 for each item returned. Proper payment is made only when the payment is made to the address shown for payments on Your statement; paid with a check drawn in U.S. dollars on a U.S. financial institution; or a U.S. dollar money order; and sent in the return envelope with only the proper return portion of the statement; with proper postage. Any other payment method may result in a delay in Our posting of Your payment. This delay may be 5 days or longer. We can accept late payments, partial payments, or payments with any restrictive writing without losing any of Our rights under this Agreement. This means that no payment, including those marked with “paid in full” or with any other restrictive words, shall operate as an accord and satisfaction without the prior written approval of one of Our senior officers. You may not use a postdated check to make a payment. If You do postdate a payment check, We may elect to honor it upon presentment or return it uncredited to the person that presented it, without in either case waiting for the date shown on the check. We are not liable to You for any loss or expense incurred by You arising out of the action We elect to take. You authorize Us to convert your check into a Substitute Check under the law commonly referred to as Check 21. This is converting a check into a copy or electronic format for processing through the check processing system."
34,8,"6. Interest Charges. Credit Purchases, Method “G”: Average Daily Balance (including New Purchases). An Interest Charge will be imposed on Credit Purchases only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance of purchases shown on your monthly statement for the previous billing cycle within 25 days from the closing date of that statement. If you elect not to pay the entire New Balance of purchases shown on your previous monthly statement within that 25-day period, an Interest Charge will be imposed on the unpaid average daily balance of such Credit Purchases from the previous statement closing date and on new Credit Purchases from the date of posting to your account during the current billing cycle, and will continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance of purchases is paid in full or until the date of payment if more than 25 days from the closing date. For Credit Purchases, the Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Credit Purchases, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Credit Purchases is determined by adding to the outstanding unpaid balance of Credit Purchases at the beginning of the billing cycle any new Credit Purchases posted to your account, and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges. Cash Advances and Balance Transfers, Method “A”: Average daily balance. The Interest Charge on cash advances begins to accrue on the date you obtain the cash advance or the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, whichever is later. For Cash Advances, the Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance is determined by adding to the Previous Balance (the outstanding balance of your account at the beginning of the billing cycle) any new Cash Advances received and any new Credit Purchases posted to your account, and subtracting any payments as received or credits as posted to your account but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be assigned based on Your creditworthiness. The Interest Charge will be calculated using one of these ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES: (1) by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of .9916%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 11.90%; or (2) by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.1583%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 13.90%; or (3) by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.325%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 15.90%, or (4) by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.4916%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 17.9%. All interest rates and Interest Charge are subject to change. In the event of an increase in these rates or charges We will provide you at least the minimum notice required by law."
34,9,"7. Default. You will be in default if You fail to make any Minimum Payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will also be in default if (a) Your ability to repay Us is materially reduced by a change in Your employment, an increase in Your obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving You, Your death or Your failure to abide by this Agreement, (b) You break any promise You have made to Us under this Agreement or any other agreement You have with Us, (c) any statement You have made in this Agreement, in connection with this Agreement or in connection with any other agreement or application You have with Us is not true, or (d) We should otherwise feel insecure in receiving payment of the Account balance for whatever reason. If You are in default, We have the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account Balance at once without notice to You. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying all Interest Charges, until what You owe has been paid, and any security given for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe. In the event of a default, You agree to pay all costs of collecting the amount You owe under this agreement including, if the unpaid balance under this plan is greater than Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) at the time of collection, reasonable attorney’s fees if the debt is referred for collection to an attorney who is not Our employee and if suit is filed, court costs"
34,10,"8. Using the Card. You may use the card issued to You to make purchases in person, over the internet, by mail or telephone from merchants and others who accept MASTERCARD® cards. In addition, You may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions participating in the MASTERCARD® program and from automated teller machines (ATMs), such as the MASTERCARD® ATM Network, which provide access to the MASTERCARD® system. (Not all ATMs provide such access). You will need to use Your Personal Identification Number (PIN) to obtain a cash advance from an ATM. If You use the Card to purchase “Cash Equivalents”, such as foreign currency, money orders, travelers checks, wire transfers, person to person money transfers, out-of-network bill payments, bets, lottery tickets, or casino gaming chips, or make a balance transfer, We may treat these as cash advances. You agree to comply with all laws when using Your Card. You agree not to use the Card for any illegal activity including Internet gambling. Display of the MASTERCARD® logo does not mean that the online merchant or the activity You are engaging in is legal. You agree to hold Us harmless for any damages or other liability arising from a transaction initiated by You or Your authorized user for the purpose of conducting an illegal activity. We reserve the right to decline authorization of transactions for activities We believe may violate law or pose significant risk to Us. The monthly statement will identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. You agree to retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify the monthly statement. When available, We may make a reasonable charge for photocopies of slips You request."
34,11,"9. Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by issuing Us a credit which We will post to Your Account. If Your credits and payments exceed what You owe Us, We will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it upon Your written request or automatically after 6 months"
34,12,"10. Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to You in U.S. Dollars. The exchange rate for transactions in foreign currency will be a rate selected by MASTERCARD® from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate MASTERCARD® itself receives, or the government mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date, plus any adjustment determined by Us. All transactions in foreign countries or foreign currency will be subject to a 1% conversion or processing fee. We may implement a dollar limit or number of transaction per day limit for foreign transactions. We may also not approve any foreign transactions. We are required by U. S. law to allow transactions made in or involving certain countries. You should contact Us before attempting any foreign transaction."
34,31,"11. Plan Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor Your Card. We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services You purchase with the Card only if You have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the plan merchant, and: (a) Your purchase was made in response to an advertisement We sent or participated in sending You, or (b) Your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in Your state or within 100 miles of Your home. Any other disputes must be resolved directly with the plan merchant by You"
34,32,"12. Security Interest. To secure Your Account, You grant Us a purchase money security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code in any goods You purchase through use of the Card. If You are in default, We will have the right to recover any of these goods which have not been paid for through Our application of Your payments.

We may always reduce Your Credit Line, refuse to make an advance or revoke Your Card and terminate this Agreement if: You have failed to comply with this Agreement; You have made false or misleading statements in any document with Us; We reevaluate Your creditworthiness and determine that You are no longer as qualified; or We have reason to believe Our ability to collect has been degraded.

35,12,"5.Payments. Each month You must pay at least the Minimum Payment shown on Your statement by the date specified on the statement or no later than 25 days from the statement closing date, whichever is later. If Your statement says the payment is “Now Due,” Your payment is due no later than 25 days from the statement closing date. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment or pay the Total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Minimum Payment is 2.5% of Your Total New Balance or $25.00, whichever is greater, not to exceed Your Total New Balance, plus the amount of any prior Minimum Payments that You have not made, and any amount You are over Your Credit Line or Credit Limit. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which You are over Your Credit Line or Credit Limit. Subject to applicable law, Your payments may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, currently, We apply payments first to Interest Charges, then to fees, then to Minimum"
35,13,"Payment for cash advances, then to Minimum Payment for purchases, then to the balance of cash advances, then to the balance of credit purchases. If a payment is ever late 10 days or more, You agree to pay Us a late charge of $20.00. If You make a payment by check or other item which for any reason is dishonored You agree to pay a fee of $20.00 for each item returned. Proper payment is made only when the payment is made to the address shown for payments on Your statement; paid with a check drawn in U.S. dollars on a U.S. financial institution; or a U.S. dollar money order; and sent in the return envelope with only the proper return portion of the statement; with proper postage. Any other payment method may result in a delay in Our posting of Your payment. This delay maybe 5 days or longer. We can accept late payments, partial payments, or payments with any restrictive writing without losing any of Our rights under this Agreement. This means that no payment, including those marked with “paid in full” or with any other restrictive words, shall operate as an accord and satisfaction without the prior written approval of one of Our senior officers. You may not use a postdated check to make a payment. If You do postdate a payment check, We may elect to honor it upon presentment or return it uncredited to the person that presented it, without in either case waiting for the date shown on the check. We are not liable to You for any loss or expense incurred by You arising out of the action We elect to take. You authorize Us to convert your check into a Substitute Check under the law commonly referred to as Check 21. This is converting a check into a copy or electronic format for processing through the check processing system."
35,14,"6. Interest Charges. Credit Purchases, Method “G”: Average Daily Balance (including New Purchases). An Interest Charge will be imposed on Credit Purchases only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance of purchases shown on your monthly statement for the previous billing cycle within 25 days from the closing date of that statement. If you elect not to pay the entire New Balance of purchases shown on your previous monthly statement within that 25-day period, an Interest Charge will be imposed on the unpaid average daily balance of such Credit Purchases from the previous statement closing date and on new Credit Purchases from the date of posting to your account during the current billing cycle, and will continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance of purchases is paid in full or until the date of payment if more than 25 days from the closing date. For Credit Purchases, the Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Credit Purchases, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Credit Purchases is determined by adding to the outstanding unpaid balance of Credit Purchases at the beginning of the billing cycle any new Credit Purchases posted to your account, and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your account, but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges. Cash Advances, Method “A”: Average daily balance. The Interest Charge on cash advances begins to accrue on the date you obtain the cash advance or the first day of the billing cycle in which it is posted to your account, whichever is later. For Cash Advances, the Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of MASTERCARD® CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT (Keep for your records) >> continued"
35,15,"adding to the Previous Balance (the outstanding balance of your account at the beginning of the billing cycle) any new Cash Advances received and any new Credit Purchases posted to your account, and subtracting any payments as received or credits as posted to your account but excluding any unpaid Interest Charges. Applies to MASTERCARD ® Level 1 only: The Interest Charge will be calculated by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.075%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12.90%. Applies to MASTERCARD ® Level 2 only: The Interest Charge will be calculated by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of .9083%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 10.90%. Applies to MASTERCARD ® Level 3 only: The Interest Charge will be calculated by multiplying the average daily balance on your Account by the Monthly Periodic Rate of .7416%, which is an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 8.90%. All interest rates and Interest Charge are subject to change. In the event of an increase in these rates or charges We will provide you at least the minimum notice required by law."
35,16,"7. Default. You will be in default if You fail to make any Minimum Payment or other required payment by the date that it is due.

36,6,"Other Terms and Conditions (including Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure) (A) The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) Purchases. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the date posted will be imposed on Purchase transactions posted during a Billing Cycle when the Previous Balance is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the first day of the next billing cycle will also be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. No Finance Charge will be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. (2) Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. A Finance Charge in the form of a Transaction Fee will be imposed on each transaction for Cash Advances posted to the Account during a Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge computed on a Periodic Rate basis will also be imposed on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers from the date posted to the Account through the date paid. The Finance Charge accrued on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers between the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle and the date your Account is credited will appear on your next statement. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid the Finance Charge on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. (3) If your Account is subject to a Finance Charge other than a Cash Advance Transaction Fee, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay, the less your Finance Charge will be."
36,7,"(B) The method of determining the balance upon which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Transaction Fee to the amount of each Cash Advance transaction posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your account (including current transactions for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your Account each day, add any new Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, and subtract any payments or credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/ Balance Transfers. There is no period beyond the allowable 25 days in which credit extended may be paid without incurring a finance charge. (3) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases on your Account (including current transactions for Purchases). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases, we take the beginning balance of Purchases on your Account each day, add any new Purchases and Other Charges (except Late Payment Charges), and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid Finance Charges and Late Payment Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases. If the entire Previous Balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle, the Average Daily Balance of Purchases will be considered to be $0"
36,8,(C) The method of determining the amount of the FINANCE CHARGE: The FINANCE CHARGE imposed during a Billing Cycle will be the sum of the Transaction Fee and Periodic Rate components of the FINANCE CHARGE determined by: (1) Applying a Transaction Fee amounting to 2% of the amount of each current transaction ($10.00 maximum per transaction) for Cash Advances posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) Applying to the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle a Monthly Periodic Rate of 0.8750% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is 10.5%).
36,9,"(D) The conditions under which any other charges may be imposed: (1) Annual Card Membership Fee. A $50.00 Annual Card Membership Fee will be charged to your Account. If at the time of the initial fee your Card will expire in less than a year, the Annual Fee will be prorated, based upon the number of months left before the Card expires. Only one fee will be charged, even if more than one Card is issued on the Account. This fee may be waived if you have an active checking account from Alaska USA. (2) Late Payment Fee. A Minimum Payment not paid within 13 days after Payment Due Date will be subject to a single charge of 5% of the Minimum Payment due ($1.00 minimum, $35.00 maximum). (3) Returned Check Charge. A $20.00 charge will be assessed to your Credit Card Account when any check submitted by you for payment on the Account is returned to us unpaid. (4) Research and Copying Fee. A $3.00 fee will be charged for each statement copy you request. A $12.00 per copy fee may be charged for copies of each document, in connection with the Account, that you request. This fee is not imposed if the copy is for the resolution of a billing error."
36,10,"(E) The conditions under which we may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the Account: (1) If we now or hereafter hold any title, pledge or security interest in any of your property, it may be that the terms of the instrument creating such title, pledge or security interest will also secure your obligation on the Account. (2) If you have pledged or shall hereafter pledge your personal residence as collateral security for any indebtedness of which we are or become the owner and holder, it is hereby understood that we hereby waive any claim we might otherwise acquire against said personal residence as collateral security for any obligation to us arising from your use of the Card."
36,11,"(F) The minimum periodic payment required: If you elect not to pay your balance in full, a payment according to the following schedule must be made by you within 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle as shown on your statement. Minimum Payment Schedule: If your New Balance is: Your Minimum Payment will be: Less than $15 New Balance in full $15 to $500 $15 More than $500 3% of New Balance (rounded up to next whole dollar) In addition to the above, the Minimum Payment will include the amount of all Past Due payments and the amount by which the New Balance exceeds the Credit Limit for the Account.

37,8,"Other Terms and Conditions (including Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure) (A) The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) Purchases. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the date posted will be imposed on Purchase transactions posted during a Billing Cycle when the Previous Balance is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the first day of the next billing cycle will also be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. No Finance Charge will be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. (2) Cash Advances/Balance Transfers.

There is no time period within which to pay to avoid the Finance Charge on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. (3) If your Account is subject to a Finance Charge other than a Cash Advance Transaction Fee, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay, the less your Finance Charge will be."
37,9,"(B) The method of determining the balance upon which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Transaction Fee to the amount of each Cash Advance transaction posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your account (including current transactions for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your Account each day, add any new Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, and subtract any payments or credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/ Balance Transfers. There is no period beyond the allowable 25 days in which credit extended may be paid without incurring a finance charge. (3) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases on your Account (including current transactions for Purchases). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases, we take the beginning balance of Purchases on your Account each day, add any new Purchases and Other Charges (except Late Payment Charges), and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid Finance Charges and Late Payment Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases. If the entire Previous Balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle, the Average Daily Balance of Purchases will be considered to be $0."
37,10,(C) The method of determining the amount of the FINANCE CHARGE: The FINANCE CHARGE imposed during a Billing Cycle will be the sum of the Transaction Fee and Periodic Rate components of the FINANCE CHARGE determined by: (1) Applying a Transaction Fee amounting to 2% of the amount of each current transaction ($10.00 maximum per transaction) for Cash Advances posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) Applying to the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle a Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.0417% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is 12.5%).
37,11,"(D) The conditions under which any other charges may be imposed: (1) Annual Card Membership Fee. A $50.00 Annual Card Membership Fee will be charged to your Account. If at the time of the initial fee your Card will expire in less than a year, the Annual Fee will be prorated, based upon the number of months left before the Card expires. Only one fee will be charged, even if more than one Card is issued on the Account. This fee may be waived if you have an active checking account from Alaska USA. (2) Late Payment Fee. A Minimum Payment not paid within 13 days after Payment Due Date will be subject to a single charge of 5% of the Minimum Payment due ($1.00 minimum, $35.00 maximum). (3) Returned Check Charge. A $20.00 charge will be assessed to your Credit Card Account when any check submitted by you for payment on the Account is returned to us unpaid. (4) Research and Copying Fee. A $3.00 fee will be charged for each statement copy you request. A $12.00 per copy fee may be charged for copies of each document, in connection with the Account, that you request. This fee is not imposed if the copy is for the resolution of a billing error."
37,12,"(E) The conditions under which we may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the Account: (1) If we now or hereafter hold any title, pledge or security interest in any of your property, it may be that the terms of the instrument creating such title, pledge or security interest will also secure your obligation on the Account. (2) If you have pledged or shall hereafter pledge your personal residence as collateral security for any indebtedness of which we are or become the owner and holder, it is hereby understood that we hereby waive any claim we might otherwise acquire against said personal residence as collateral security for any obligation to us arising from your use of the Card."
37,13,"(F) The minimum periodic payment required: If you elect not to pay your balance in full, a payment according to the following schedule must be made by you within 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle as shown on your statement.

38,8,"Other Terms and Conditions (including Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure) (A) The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) Purchases. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the date posted will be imposed on Purchase transactions posted during a Billing Cycle when the Previous Balance is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the first day of the next billing cycle will also be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. No Finance Charge will be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. (2) Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. A Finance Charge in the form of a Transaction Fee will be imposed on each transaction for Cash Advances posted to the Account during a Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge computed on a Periodic Rate basis will also be imposed on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers from the date posted to the Account through the date paid. The Finance Charge accrued on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers between the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle and the date your Account is credited will appear on your next statement. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid the Finance Charge on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. (3) If your Account is subject to a Finance Charge other than a Cash Advance Transaction Fee, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay, the less your Finance Charge will be."
38,9,"(B) The method of determining the balance upon which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Transaction Fee to the amount of each Cash Advance transaction posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your account (including current transactions for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your Account each day, add any new Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, and subtract any payments or credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/ Balance Transfers. There is no period beyond the allowable 25 days in which credit extended may be paid without incurring a finance charge. (3) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases on your Account (including current transactions for Purchases). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases, we take the beginning balance of Purchases on your Account each day, add any new Purchases and Other Charges (except Late Payment Charges), and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid Finance Charges and Late Payment Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases. If the entire Previous Balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle, the Average Daily Balance of Purchases will be considered to be $0."
38,10,(C) The method of determining the amount of the FINANCE CHARGE: The FINANCE CHARGE imposed during a Billing Cycle will be the sum of the Transaction Fee and Periodic Rate components of the FINANCE CHARGE determined by: (1) Applying a Transaction Fee amounting to 2% of the amount of each current transaction ($10.00 maximum per transaction) for Cash Advances posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) Applying to the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle a Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.2083% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is 14.5%).
38,11,"(D) The conditions under which any other charges may be imposed: (1) Annual Card Membership Fee. A $50.00 Annual Card Membership Fee will be charged to your Account. If at the time of the initial fee your Card will expire in less than a year, the Annual Fee will be prorated, based upon the number of months left before the Card expires. Only one fee will be charged, even if more than one Card is issued on the Account. This fee may be waived if you have an active checking account from Alaska USA. (2) Late Payment Fee. A Minimum Payment not paid within 13 days after Payment Due Date will be subject to a single charge of 5% of the Minimum Payment due ($1.00 minimum, $35.00 maximum). (3) Returned Check Charge. A $20.00 charge will be assessed to your Credit Card Account when any check submitted by you for payment on the Account is returned to us unpaid. (4) Research and Copying Fee. A $3.00 fee will be charged for each statement copy you request. A $12.00 per copy fee may be charged for copies of each document, in connection with the Account, that you request. This fee is not imposed if the copy is for the resolution of a billing error."
38,12,"(E) The conditions under which we may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the Account: (1) If we now or hereafter hold any title, pledge or security interest in any of your property, it may be that the terms of the instrument creating such title, pledge or security interest will also secure your obligation on the Account. (2) If you have pledged or shall hereafter pledge your personal residence as collateral security for any indebtedness of which we are or become the owner and holder, it is hereby understood that we hereby waive any claim we might otherwise acquire against said personal residence as collateral security for any obligation to us arising from your use of the Card."
38,13,"(F) The minimum periodic payment required: If you elect not to pay your balance in full, a payment according to the following schedule must be made by you within 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle as shown on your statement.

39,7,"Other Terms and Conditions (including Federal Truth in Lending Disclosure) (A) The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) Purchases. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the date posted will be imposed on Purchase transactions posted during a Billing Cycle when the Previous Balance is not paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge that will accrue from the first day of the next billing cycle will also be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is not paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. No Finance Charge will be imposed on Purchases included in the New Balance when the entire New Balance is paid in full within 25 days after the Closing Date. (2) Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. A Finance Charge in the form of a Transaction Fee will be imposed on each transaction for Cash Advances posted to the Account during a Billing Cycle. A Finance Charge computed on a Periodic Rate basis will also be imposed on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers from the date posted to the Account through the date paid. The Finance Charge accrued on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers between the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle and the date your Account is credited will appear on your next statement. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid the Finance Charge on Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. (3) If your Account is subject to a Finance Charge other than a Cash Advance Transaction Fee, then the more that you pay and the sooner you pay, the less your Finance Charge will be."
39,8,"The method of determining the balance upon which a Finance Charge will be imposed: (1) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Transaction Fee to the amount of each Cash Advance transaction posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your account (including current transactions for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances/Balance Transfers on your Account each day, add any new Cash Advances/Balance Transfers, and subtract any payments or credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances/Balance Transfers. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Cash Advances/ Balance Transfers. There is no period beyond the allowable 25 days in which credit extended may be paid without incurring a finance charge. (3) We figure a portion of the Finance Charge on your Account by applying a Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases on your Account (including current transactions for Purchases). To get the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases, we take the beginning balance of Purchases on your Account each day, add any new Purchases and Other Charges (except Late Payment Charges), and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid Finance Charges and Late Payment Charges. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add up all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle and divide by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance” of Purchases. If the entire Previous Balance is paid in full within the first 25 days of the Billing Cycle, the Average Daily Balance of Purchases will be considered to be $0"
39,9,The method of determining the amount of the FINANCE CHARGE: The FINANCE CHARGE imposed during a Billing Cycle will be the sum of the Transaction Fee and Periodic Rate components of the FINANCE CHARGE determined by: (1) Applying a Transaction Fee amounting to 2% of the amount of each current transaction ($10.00 maximum per transaction) for Cash Advances posted during the Billing Cycle. (2) Applying to the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle a Monthly Periodic Rate of 1.2083% (corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE is 14.5%).
39,10,"The conditions under which any other charges may be imposed: (1) Annual Card Membership Fee. A $50.00 Annual Card Membership Fee will be charged to your Account. If at the time of the initial fee your Card will expire in less than a year, the Annual Fee will be prorated, based upon the number of months left before the Card expires. Only one fee will be charged, even if more than one Card is issued on the Account. This fee may be waived if you have an active checking account from Alaska USA FCU. (2) Late Payment Fee. A Minimum Payment not paid within 13 days after Payment Due Date will be subject to a single charge of 5% of the Minimum Payment due ($1.00 minimum, $35.00 maximum). (3) Returned Check Charge. A $20.00 charge will be assessed to your Credit Card Account when any check submitted by you for payment on the Account is returned to us unpaid. (4) Research and Copying Fee. A $3.00 fee will be charged for each statement copy you request. A $12.00 per copy fee may be charged for copies of each document, in connection with the Account, that you request. This fee is not imposed if the copy is for the resolution of a billing error."
39,11,"The conditions under which we may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the Account: (1) We hold a security interest in your share/savings account.

39,12,"The minimum periodic payment required: If you elect not to pay your balance in full, a payment according to the following schedule must be made by you within 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle as shown on your statement.

After the initial Card has been issued for your Account, if you request and we agree to provide an additional Card to be issued in the name of an Authorized User or you request and we agree to permit an Authorized User who accepts full contractual liability for the account, to be added to your Account, we will charge an Additional Card Fee for the approval of your request and the issuance of another Card to your Account. This fee will be charged to your Account on the date that your request is processed"
101,29,"Replacement Card Fee. After a Card has been issued in your name, if you request and we agree to provide a replacement Card, we will charge a Replacement Card Fee for the Card’s replacement. This fee also applies to any Authorized User. This fee will be charged to your Account on the date that your request is processed"
101,30,"Automated Account Information Fee. We will charge you to access our automated account information system through our toll free telephone number. The first two inquiries per Billing Cycle will not incur a charge. Thereafter, a fee for each separate Account inquiry you make through our automated account information system will be assessed. This fee(s) will be charged to your Account on the same day that you make your inquires. You will be charged for each separate inquiry you make even if you make more than one inquiry during the same call. This fee may also be referred and listed on your Statement as an “excessive pinpoint transaction.”"
101,31,"Fees for Optional Payments. If you choose and we allow you to make an expedited payment by telephone with the assistance of one of our associates or agents to post to your Account the same day or, if the payment is made or received after 5:00 p.m., we will assess a fee to your account on the date that your payment is initiated."
101,32,"Miscellaneous Fees. If permitted by applicable law, we may charge you any reasonable fees for services rendered or for reimbursement of expenses, incurred in good faith by us or our agents in connection with your Account, or other reasonable fees in connection with our administering, terminating or reinstating your Account. For example, if you continue to use the Account after we advise you that your credit privileges have been terminated, we may charge you for any fee imposed on recapture of the Card(s) or Cash Advance Checks."
101,33,"Interest Charges. Your Account is subject to the following Interest Charges, which may appear as either a Fee or Interest on your Statement: (1) a Cash Advance Fee, which is imposed on the same day we honor any Cash Advance and added to your Cash Advance balance (please note that in the Billing Cycle in which a Cash Advance is posted, the Cash Advance Fee will cause the “Annual Percentage Rate” for Cash Advances to exceed the “Corresponding Annual Percentage Rate” for Cash Advances shown on your Statement for that Billing Cycle); (2) a “Periodic Rate Interest Charge,” which is calculated on the Purchase and Cash Advance average daily balance of your Account as described in this Agreement. This charge will be assessed to your Account on the Closing Date; (3) a “Credit Limit Increase Fee” which may be charged on the same day we approve each unsecured credit limit increase after your Account is opened; (4) an “Upgrade Fee”, which may be charged on the same date we approve any product upgrade (i.e. standard to gold); (5) a “Foreign Currency Transaction Fee” is applied to any transaction made in a foreign currency that is converted to U. S. Dollars by Visa or MasterCard or any transaction made in a foreign country even if it is in U.S. Dollars (please note that this fee will be added on the same date to the same balance to which the foreign transaction is added); and (6) a “Minimum Interest Charge”, which will be charged for a Billing Cycle during which there exists any Purchases and/or Cash Advances balance of $1 or greater in your Account."
101,34,"Grace Period. There is no Grace Period for the Account. Interest Charges accrue on Purchases, Cash Advances and Our Charges beginning on the date the transaction occurs or on the first day of the Billing Cycle in which the transaction is received by us or, at our option, the date the transaction is posted to your Account. Periodic Rate Interest Charges continue to accrue until payment in full is received."
101,35,Periodic Rate Interest Charge Calculation-Average Daily Balance Method (Including New Transactions) for Purchases and Cash Advances. (1) To determine the Periodic Rate Interest Charge for Purchases and Cash Advances we multiply the monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases and Cash Advances by the “average daily balance” for Purchases and Cash Advances (including new transactions) for the current Billing Cycle.
101,36,"The total Interest Charge imposed on your Account each Billing Cycle is the sum of the Periodic Rate Interest Charges as calculated for Purchases and Cash Advances for the current Billing Cycle, all Cash Advance Fees, and any Fees described in the Our Charges section of this agreement that may be imposed during such Billing Cycle. Purchases. To get the “average daily balance” of Purchases for a Billing Cycle, we take the beginning balance of Purchases in your Account each day, add any new Purchases, and subtract any payments or credits which are applied to Purchases (treating any negative balances 7 as zero). On the first day of each Billing Cycle, we add the unpaid Periodic Rate Interest Charges for Purchases for the prior Billing Cycle to the daily balance of Purchases. (In this way, we compound Interest Charges on Purchases on your Account on a monthly basis.) This gives us the daily balance of Purchases. Then, we add up all the daily balances of Purchases for the Billing Cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance” of Purchases for a Billing Cycle. There is no grace period in which Purchases may be repaid without incurring an Interest Charge."
101,37,"Cash Advances. To get the “average daily balance” of Cash Advances for a Billing 
Cycle, we take the beginning balance of Cash Advances in your Account each day, add any 
new Cash Advances, and subtract any payments or credits which are applied to Cash Advances 
(treating any negative balances as zero). On the first day of each Billing Cycle, we add the 
unpaid Periodic Rate Interest Charges for Cash Advances for the prior Billing Cycle to the 
daily balance of Cash Advances. (In this way, we compound Interest Charges on Cash 
Advances on your Account on a monthly basis.) This gives us the daily balance of Cash 
Advances. Then, we add up all the daily balances of Cash Advances for the Billing Cycle and 
divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the “average daily 
balance” of Cash Advances for a Billing Cycle. There is no grace period in which Cash 
Advances may be repaid without incurring an Interest Charge."
101,38,"General Periodic Rates. See “Schedule of Rates and Fees” enclosed with this Agreement. Credit Availability. If payments on your account are made by guaranteed funds (for example, money orders and cashier’s checks), your credit availability will be increased on the day after your deposit or payment is credited. All other deposits or payments may not increase your credit availability until we are assured that the payment has not been dishonored. This could take up to 14 calendar days (or longer)."
101,39,"Minimum Payments. You may pay your entire balance at any time, without penalty or premium. Whenever a balance is due, however, each month you must pay us at least the Minimum Payment Due, which we must receive on or before the Payment Due Date shown on the Statement, in accordance with any hour of receipt and other payment instructions shown on your monthly Statement. The Payment Due Date will be approximately 25 days after the Closing Date. The Minimum Payment Due in any monthly Billing Cycle will be equal to the sum of (i) 2.25% of your New Balance plus the total of all Periodic Rate Interest Charges that have accrued in the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is being calculated (rounded up to the next dollar) or $35, whichever is more (or your entire New Balance if less than $35); plus (ii) all past due amounts; plus (iii) the amount of any Late Fee charged in the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is being calculated."
101,40,"Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payment up to the Minimum Payment Due and any credits on your Account among balances and Charges in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. You agree that we have the unconditional right to exercise this discretion in a way that is most favorable or convenient to us. Generally, the amount of payments credited to your Account during a Billing Cycle will be applied first to the balance bearing the lowest APR and then to balances bearing the higher APR, until the Minimum Payment Due payable in the Billing Cycle is credited to your Account. After that, the amount of payments remaining will be applied to the balance bearing the highest APR and then to balances bearing the lower APR in descending order. In most cases, credits will be applied first to the balance from which the corresponding debit originated."
101,41,"Security. You grant us a security interest and pledge and assign to us any and all sums now or later in any Deposit established by you to secure payment of all of your existing and future obligations under this Agreement and your Account. The Deposit must be maintained with us unencumbered (i.e. not subject to any lien, judgment, attachment or execution) at all times. You may add to the Deposit at any time. With our consent, you may also withdraw from the Deposit, which will reduce your Credit Limit by a like amount, so long as you do not cause the outstanding balance in the Account to exceed your new, lower Credit Limit. You agree that we may restrict your right to obtain withdrawals from the Deposit. Upon a Default and without notice to you, we may apply any sums then in the Deposit against what you then owe on your Account. We may retain the Deposit or any sums remaining in the Deposit until the latest of the following events: (i) 14 days after the time all sums owed to us on your Account are paid in full, (ii) 10 weeks from the time we receive from you all of the unexpired Cards and Cash Advance Checks, cut in half, or (iii) 10 weeks from the time of termination of your Account. Except for the Deposit, we do not have a security interest in any other of your property in connection with your Account."
101,42,"Terminating Credit Privileges and Closing Your Account. You or we can terminate your credit privileges at any time for any reason, including but not limited to when you are in Default under this Agreement. If you or we terminate your credit privileges, you promise that any amounts that you owe us at the time of termination, plus any new Purchases or Cash Advances, plus any Interest Charges and other fees and charges that will continue to be imposed at the rates and in the amounts specified in this Agreement, will be repaid according to this Agreement."
101,43,"You may Close your Account at any time. In order to close your Account, you must: give us written notice of your intent to close your Account at the address for inquiries shown on your Statement, and pay your outstanding balance in full. Your notice to close your Account will become effective as soon as we can reasonably act on it. If you request to close your Account, but do not pay your outstanding balance in full, your credit privileges will be terminated. If you close your account, the terms of this Agreement remain in effect."
101,44,"Default. You will be in default of this Agreement (“Default”) if any of the following occur: 1. You do not make a Minimum Payment on your Account on or before the Payment Due Date; 2. You die or are declared legally incompetent; 3. You become insolvent or bankrupt; 4. You exceed or attempt to exceed the Credit Limit; 5. You provide us with false or misleading information or signatures at any time or use your Account in any fraudulent or unlawful manner; 6. You fail to comply with this Agreement; 7. You fail to make any payment or perform any promise in any other agreement or obligation you have with us; or 8. Any judgment, lien, attachment or execution is issued against you, the Deposit or your other property."
101,45,"If you are in Default, we may immediately terminate your credit privileges on your Account and any other credit account(s) you may have with us. We need not give you notice of termination. We may also demand that you immediately pay us all sums owing on your Account and any other credit account(s) you may have with us, including all unpaid Interest 9 Charges and other charges. We may also combine the outstanding balance on your Account with the balances of any other credit account(s) you may have with us regardless of whether or not that account is past due. Without notice to you, we may also apply any sums then in the Deposit, including interest, if any, you earned on the Deposit, against what you then owe on your Account. We may also demand that you cut the Card(s) and Cash Advance Checks in half and immediately return them to us. Although we may have declared your Account to be in Default, you agree to pay us Interest Charges and other charges at the rates provided in this Agreement until all sums you owe us are paid in full, even if we have demanded that you make immediate payment in full."
101,46,"If we waive a Default, we do not waive the right to declare the same or another event occurring later as a Default of your Account. If we start collection proceedings to recover amounts you owe us on this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law you agree to pay the reasonable fees of our attorneys who are not our regularly salaried employees, all fees paid to third parties who collect on your debt for us, and all of our court, arbitration or other collection charges."
101,47,"Check Return. If we issue Cash Advance Checks or drafts to you for use with your Account, you agree that we need not return to you those that you use. If you need evidence of any payment made to a merchant or other person by a Cash Advance Check or draft, you agree that a photocopy or similar reproduction we provide to you will be satisfactory for such purposes. Such copies are subject to the Copying Charges listed in the Our Charges section of this Agreement."

We are not responsible if any ATM or other device fails to operate or operates improperly. Lost or Stolen Cards or Checks.

A restricted transaction is a transaction or transmittal involving any credit, funds, instrument, or proceeds in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful internet gambling."
101,50,"Severability and Waiver. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under any law, rule or regulation, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. We may delay or waive enforcing any of our rights under this Agreement without losing them."
101,51,"Changing This Agreement. We may change the terms of this Agreement at any time and from time to time and including, without limitation, by increasing existing annual or other fees, adding new fees, adding other new terms or deleting or modifying any existing terms.

As permitted by law, we may obtain consumer credit reports and information about you for updates, renewals, extensions of credit, 10 review or collection of your Account and any other permissible purpose. We may furnish information about you and your Account to consumer reporting agencies and others who help service your Account."
101,53,"Governing Law. This Agreement and your Account will be governed by, and interpreted under Federal law and the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws.

If you make a transaction in a foreign currency, MasterCard or Visa, depending on your card type, will convert the foreign currency transaction amount into a U.S. dollar amount. MasterCard or Visa will act in accordance with their operating regulations or foreign currency conversion procedures then in effect.

Visa currently uses a conversion rate in effect on its central processing date. Such rate is either a rate it selects from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets, which may vary from the rate Visa receives or the government mandated rate. We may impose a Foreign Currency Transaction Fee as described in the Interest Charges section of this Agreement."

The person or entity to whom we make any such sale, assignment or transfer shall be entitled to all of our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, to the extent sold, assigned or transferred."
101,61,Arbitration. Arbitration is a method of deciding disputes outside the court system. This Arbitration Provision governs when and how any disputes you and we may have will be arbitrated instead of litigated in court.
101,62,"Certain Definitions. Certain capitalized words used in this Arbitration Provision have special meanings: “We,” “us,” and “our” do not mean just the Bank. These terms also include: (1) any parent company of the Bank, all companies owned by, controlled by or under common ownership or control with the parent company or the Bank, including but not limited to Applied Card Systems, Inc.; (2) any prior issuer of the Account; (3) any company to which we transfer our rights under this Agreement; and (4) all of the employees or other individuals who manage or own these companies. Finally, if either you or we elect to arbitrate any Claim you bring against us, these terms include any other persons or companies who you make Claims against in the same proceeding."
101,63,"“Claim” means any dispute between you and us that cannot be resolved without a judicial or arbitration proceeding and arises as a result of, or has anything at all to do with: (1) your Account; (2) the events leading up to your becoming an Account holder; (3) this Agreement (including this Arbitration Provision); (4) any prior credit account or agreement relating to such account; or (5) your relationship with us. This includes disputes relating to any products, insurance or other services offered to you as an Account holder. This includes disputes about whether this Arbitration Provision is valid or binding; about whether or when it applies; and whether a dispute is arbitrable."
101,64,"It includes disputes relating to constitutional 12 provisions; statutes; ordinances; regulations; court decisions; compliance with the Agreement or a related contract; and wrongful acts of every type (whether intentional; fraudulent; reckless; or just negligent). It includes requests for money, for orders requiring you or us to take certain actions (which are sometimes referred to as “injunctive relief”), for declarations of legal rights and for any other kind of relief. This Arbitration Provision applies to Claims that arise prior to the effective date of this Arbitration Provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute concerning the validity or effect of the part of this Arbitration Provision captioned “NO CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS” shall not be subject to this Arbitration Provision and shall be resolved by a court and not an arbitrator."
101,65,"“Administrator” means the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), 335 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017, www.adr.org, or, in the event that AAA is not available as a forum for arbitration of a Claim, such alternative forum which administrates arbitration of a Claim in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. and the Administrator’s Rules. The arbitrator will be selected under the Administrator’s Rules. You can select the arbitrator if you give us written notice of your selection with your notice that you are electing to arbitrate any Claim or within 20 days after we give you notice that we are electing to arbitrate any Claim. If you do not select the arbitrator on time, we will select one. If for any reason the arbitrator you or we select is unable or unwilling to serve or continue to serve as arbitrator , you will have 20 days to select a different arbitrator."
101,66,"Starting an Arbitration. You or we can give written notice of an intention to begin arbitration of a Claim or Claims or to require arbitration of the other party’s Claim or Claims. This notice can be given by one party even if the other party has begun a lawsuit. If such a notice is given, any Claim will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Provision and the Administrator’s Rules that are in effect at the time the Claim is filed with the Administrator. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with more than 10 years of experience or a retired judge, unless you and we agree otherwise. A copy of the Claim form may be obtained from the Administrator or from us. A party who has asserted a Claim in a lawsuit may still elect arbitration with respect to any Claim that is later asserted in the same lawsuit by any other party. All doubts about whether to arbitrate a Claim shall be resolved in favor of arbitration."
101,67,"We will not elect to arbitrate an individual Claim that you bring against us in “small claims” court (or the equivalent court in your state). However, we may elect to arbitrate a “small claims” court Claim that is later transferred, removed or appealed to any different court."
101,68,"If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to pursue that Claim in court or have a jury decide the Claim. Also, the ability of a party to obtain information from the other party and to appeal, is more limited in an arbitration than in a lawsuit. Other rights that you or we would have in court may also not be available in arbitration. The fees charged by the administrator may be higher than the fees charged by a court."
101,69,"If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim: (1) neither you nor anyone else on your behalf can pursue that Claim in court or in an arbitration proceeding on a class-wide or representative basis; and (2) Claims brought by or against one account holder (or joint account holders) may not be brought together with Claims brought by or against any 13 other account holder. The arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or decide an arbitration on a class-wide or representative basis. However, this prohibition against class actions is not applicable to cardholders residing in the State of California."
101,70,"Arbitration Location and Costs. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place at a location reasonably convenient to your residence. In the event that you file a Claim against us and you cannot afford to pay the fees charged by the Administrator and the arbitrator or if you believe that such fees are too high, and you cannot obtain a fee waiver, we will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to advance the fees. We will pay any fees or expenses we are required to pay by law. The arbitrator will decide who will be ultimately responsible for paying those fees. In the event that you file a Claim against us, in no event will you be required to reimburse us for any arbitration filing, administrative or hearing fees in an amount greater than what your court costs would have been if the Claim had been resolved in a state court with jurisdiction. In the event that we file a Claim against you, the arbitrator will decide who is responsible for paying all costs for arbitrating the Claim."
101,71,"Governing Law. This Agreement involves interstate commerce and this Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§1 et seq. The arbitrator must follow: (1) the FAA; (2) the substantive law, consistent with the FAA, related to any Claim; (3) statutes of limitations; and (4) claims of privilege recognized at law. Upon the timely request of either party, the arbitrator must provide a brief written explanation of the basis for the award. The arbitrator will determine the rules of procedure and evidence to apply, consistent with the FAA, the Administrator’s Rules and this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator shall not apply federal, state or local rules of procedure and evidence or state or local laws concerning arbitration proceedings."
101,72,"Obtaining Information. After an arbitration has been started, in addition to a party’s right to obtain information from the other party under the Administrator’s Rules, either party may request the arbitrator in writing to allow that party to obtain more information from the other party. A copy of such request must be provided to the other party. That party will then have the chance to object in writing. The objection must be sent to the arbitrator and the other party. The arbitrator will decide the issue, in his or her sole discretion."
101,73,"Effect of Arbitration Award. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA and except for Claims that involve requests for monetary relief exceeding $100,000 or requests for injunctive or declaratory relief that could cost any party more than $100,000. For these large Claims, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator. That panel will consider all over again any part of the initial award that any party asserts was incorrectly decided. The decision of the panel will be by majority vote and will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the fees charged by the Administrator, and the arbitrators for such an appeal, are to be paid by the appealing party, regardless of who wins the appeal. However, we will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to pay such fees. All other provisions of this Arbitration Provision shall apply to any appeal to a three-arbitrator panel and any reference in this Arbitration Provision to a single arbitrator shall apply to the three-arbitrator panel."
101,74,"Continued Effect of Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision governs, notwithstanding any prior arbitration provision between you and us. This Arbitration Provision 14 will remain in force no matter what happens to you or your Account. For example, it will remain in force even if: (1) your credit privileges are ended or put on hold; (2) you close your Account; (3) you repay your entire Account balance; (4) we begin a lawsuit to collect amounts we think you owe; or (5) you become bankrupt or insolvent or a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is begun, to the extent consistent with applicable bankruptcy law."
101,75,"If any portion of this Arbitration Provision cannot be enforced for any reason, the rest of this Arbitration Provision will continue to apply. However, if the part of this Arbitration Provision captioned “NO CLASS ACTIONS OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS” is struck in a proceeding brought as a class action or representative action, the entire Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) shall be null and void in such proceeding, provided that we and you retain the right to contest through appeal or further available judicial proceedings any determination with respect to this part of the Arbitration Provision. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Arbitration Provision, on the one hand, and the Administrator’s Rules or other provisions of this Agreement, on the other hand, this Arbitration Provision will govern."
101,76,"Rejection of Arbitration Provision. You may reject this Arbitration Provision, (and any prior arbitration provision between you and us) by sending us a notice (“Rejection Notice”) that we receive within thirty (30) days after you open your Account. Any Rejection Notice must include your name, address and telephone number and must be signed by you. You must mail your Rejection Notice or send it by messenger service (such as Federal Express) to us at our Legal Department at P.O. Box 15803, Wilmington, DE 19850 or to any bank branch. In the event of any dispute concerning whether you have provided a timely Rejection Notice, you must provide a signed receipt as confirmation. This is the only method you can use to reject this Arbitration Provision."

101,79,"Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct."
101,80,"While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit access line."
101,81,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest
or other fees related to that amount.If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question,along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe."
101,82,"If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 
10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent 
without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone 
to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the 
matter has been settled between us.If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct."

have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant (in writing), you may have the right not to 
pay the remaining amount due on the property or services. There are some limitations on this right: 
• You must have made the purchase in your home state, or, if not within your home state, within 100 miles of 
your current mailing 
address. 
• The purchase price must have been more than $50. 
• You have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant directly in writing. 
• You act timely."
104,11,"These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for 
the property or services. 
In order to continue benefits of an Arizona Central Credit Union Visa Credit Card, you must remain a member 
in good standing. One requirement is that you maintain a minimum share in your account with us."
104,12,"Responsibility. If we issue you a card, you agree to repay all debts and the FINANCE CHARGE arising from the 
use of the card account. For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, your spouse and minor 
children and anyone you allow to use the card or to whom you give the personal identification number (PIN). 
You are also responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom you give your card, and this responsibility 
continues until the credit union is notified in writing. You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but we 
will close the account for new transactions. Your obligation to pay the account balance continues even though 
an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct you or one of 
the other persons responsible to pay the account. Any person using the card is jointly responsible with you for 
charges he or she makes, but if that person signs the card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is 
also jointly responsible for all charges on the account, including yours."
104,13,"Lost/Stolen Card Notification. If you believe the card has been lost or stolen, you will immediately call the 
credit union at 
(602) 264-6421 or toll free at 1-866-264-6421. You may be charged a recovery fee up to $75.00 if you or your 
joint owner(s) use Visa Card(s) that have been reported lost or stolen. A $10.00 fee may be assessed for each replacement card."
104,14,"Liability for Unauthorized Use. You understand that your liability to the credit union shall not exceed $50.00 
for any card transactions resulting from the loss, theft or other unauthorized use of the card, provided that 
the notice is timely, within two (2) days of discovering the card lost or missing. Also, if you do not tell us within 
sixty (60) days after we sent you the first statement on which the error/problem appeared, you may not get 
back any money you lost after the sixty (60) days if we could have stopped someone from taking the money."
104,15,"Credit Line. Upon approval, we will establish a self-replenishing line of credit for you and notify you of its 
amount when we issue the card. You agree not to let the account balance exceed this approved credit line. 
Each payment you make on the account will restore you credit line by the amount of the payment which is 
applied to principal. We may reduce your credit line, or revoke your card, and terminate this agreement. If 
negative action is taken, you will be provided an adverse action notice. Cause includes your failure to comply 
with this agreement or our adverse reevaluation of your creditworthiness. You may also terminate this 
agreement at any time by paying the balance in full and turning in any outstanding cards, but termination by 
either of us does not affect your obligation to pay the account balance. The cards remain our property and you 
must recover and surrender to us all cards upon our request and/or upon termination of this Agreement."
104,16,"From time to time, ACCU may upon request or on its own initiative increase your credit limit. By making an 
authorized purchase and or cash advance you agree to adhere to the terms and conditions set-forth by the 
Credit Union in its disclosures."
104,17,"Credit Information. You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing or 
reviewing your account, and you authorize us to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus 
and other creditors who inquire of us about your credit standing."
104,18,"Monthly Payment. You will be sent a statement every month showing your previous balance of purchases 
and cash advances, the current transactions on your account, the remaining credit available under the credit 
line, the new balances of purchases and cash advances, the total new balance, the FINANCE CHARGE due to 
date, and the minimum payment within 25 days of your statement closing date, which is the last day of the 
month. You may of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new 
balance in full, and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. The minimum payment will be either (a) 
2.5% of your total new balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your total new balance, if it is less than 
$10.00, plus (c) any portion of the minimum payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. 
In addition, at any time your total new balance exceeds your credit line, you must immediately pay the excess. 
We will apply your payments first to LATE CHARGES; then to previously billed and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES; 
then to previously billed purchases; then to new purchases, whether or not billed on the monthly statement; 
and then cash advances."
104,19,"Finance Charges. You can avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases by paying the full amount of the new 
balance of purchases each month within 25 days of your statement closing date, which is the last day of the 
month. Otherwise, the new balance of purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to 
your account, will be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE. Cash advances are always subject to a FINANCE CHARGE from the date they are posted to your account. Foreign Transactions are subject to a currency conversion 
fee which is considered a FINANCE CHARGE. FINANCE CHARGES (interest) is calculated on your balances or 
purchases and cash advances for foreign transactions in the account."
104,20,"Daily principal balance is calculated separately from purchases and cash advances and is determined as follows: For 
each day during the statement period (billing cycle) the principal balance of purchases and of cash advances from 
the previous day are increased by any purchases or cash advances posted to the account that day. Each separate 
daily principal balance on the loan account is then multiplied by the number of days that balance was owing, times 
the daily rate, and then added together. Late Charges: $25.00 on payments made more than 5 days after their due 
date."
104,21,"Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will 
be billed to you in U.S. Dollars. The conversion rate to dollars will be made in accordance with the operation 
regulations for international transactions established by Visa International, Inc."
104,22,"Foreign Transactions. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will 
be billed to you in U.S. Dollars. The conversion rate to dollars will be made in accordance with the operation 
regulations for international transactions established by Visa International, Inc."
104,23,"Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment within 25 days after your monthly 
statement closing date. You will also be in default if your ability to repay us is materially reduced by an increase in 
your obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving you, your death or your failure to abide by this 
agreement, or if the value of our security interest materially declines. We have the right to demand immediate 
payment of your full account balance if you default, subject to our giving you notice as required by law. To the 
extent permitted by law, you will also be required to pay our collection expenses, including court costs and 
reasonable attorneys’ fees. All sums are due and payable in Maricopa County."
104,24,"Using the Card. To make a purchase or cash advance, there are two alternative procedures to be followed. 
One is for you to present the card to a participating Visa plan merchant, to us or to another financial institution, 
and sign the sales or cash advance draft which will be imprinted with your card. The other is to complete the 
transaction by using your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in conjunction with the card in an Automated Teller 
Machine or other type of electronic terminal that provides access to the Visa system. The monthly statement will 
identify the merchant, electronic terminal or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, 
cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with the statement. You will retain the copy of such slips 
furnished at the time of the transaction in order to verify the monthly statement. The credit union may make a 
reasonable charge for photocopies of slips you may request."
104,25,"Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the card may give credit for returns or 
adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit slip, which we will post to your account. If your credits and 
payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash 
advances; if it is $1 or more, refund it on your written request or automatically after 6 months."
104,26,"Plan Merchant Disputes. We are not responsible for the refusal of any plan merchant or financial institution to honor your card. We are subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you 
purchase with the card only if you have made a good faith attempt, but have been unable to obtain satisfaction 
from the plan merchant, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement we sent or participated 
in sending you, or (b) your purchase cost more than $50 and was made from a plan merchant in your state or 
within 100 miles of your home. Any other disputes you must resolve directly with the plan merchant."
104,27,"Security Interest. By signing an application, acceptance, or authorized use of any credit cards, you grant and 
pledge a consensual lien to us on all shares to secure payment of your obligations on this account. In addition, you 
acknowledge our statutory lien rights under the Federal Credit Union Act; you agree that such a lien is impressed 
as of the date that this account is opened; and you agree that we can apply the shares pledged at the time of any 
default on this account without further notice. “Shares” for the purpose of your pledge to secure your obligations 
to the Credit Union means all deposits in any share shavings, share draft, club, certificate, P.O.D., revocable 
trust or custodial account(s), whether jointly or individually held – regardless of contributions, that you have on 
deposit now or in the future. Your pledge does not include any IRA, Keogh, Health Savings Accounts, tax escrow, 
irrevocable trust or fiduciary account in which you do not have a vested ownership interest."
104,28,"Effect of Agreement. This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even 
though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips you sign may contain different terms. We may amend this 
agreement from time to time by sending you the advance written notice as required by law. Your use of the card 
thereafter will indicate your agreement to the amendments. To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our 
notice, amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions."

credit limit. You agree not to present your Card or obtain a cash advance for any

exceed your credit limit, you agree to make immediate payment sufficient to bring 
the balance below the credit limit. Certain purchases and cash advances require 
authorization prior to completion of the transaction. In some cases, you may be 
asked to provide identification. If our system is not working, we may not be able to 
authorize a transaction, even though you have sufficient credit available. Also, for

statement. Your continued use of the Card will show your agreement to any such 
increase. If you object to an increase in your credit limit, you must notify us in

does not contain sufficient funds, no automatic deduction will be made, your 
account will be charged an overdraft fee, and you will be responsible for making 
the payment by some other means."
105,28,"Overdraft Protection. Available funds from this Account will be used as a form of 
Overdraft Protection. In the event your checking account is overdrawn, available 
funds will be transferred in a sufficient amount to cover the overdraft and any fees

has no obligation to notify you of any advance under the Overdraft Protection Plan 
Agreement."

agreement with us, we will change the interest rate to the rate that is then 
applicable to your Account, which will become effective on the first day of the billing 
cycle following the sixth consecutive billing cycle"

make (""skip"") a minimum payment during certain designated billing cycles (""skip 
payment period""). If you skip a payment, you understand that we will continue to 
apply interest charges to your Account. We have no obligation to accept your 
application for any skip payment period offered, and you authorize us to 
investigate your creditworthiness including obtaining consumer credit reports."

Account or the transactions you make: (1) when it is necessary for completing 
transactions, or (2) in order to verify the existence and condition of your Account 
for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant, or (3) in order to comply with 
government agency or court orders, or (4) if you give us your written permission."
105,32,"Illegal Transactions. You agree that your Card and Account will not be used to 
make or facilitate any illegal transactions as determined by applicable law; and that 
any such use will constitute an event of default under this Agreement. We may 
decline any transaction that we believe to be illegal under applicable law, including 
but not limited to any transaction involving or relating to any gambling activity. You 
agree that we will have no liability or responsibility for any such use by you or any 
authorized user(s); or for declining any such transaction. You further agree to 
indemnify and hold us harmless from any suits, liability, damages or adverse action 
of any kind that results directly or indirectly from such illegal use. You promise to 
pay us any and all amounts owing on your Card for any transactions made by you, 
even if the transaction is determined to be illegal."
105,33,"Joint Accounts. Each of you will be responsible, jointly and severally, for the 
repayment of amounts owed, regardless of who initiated any transaction under the 
Account. 
If there are joint obligors or authorized users for this Account, each of you will have 
the right to use the Account to obtain loans pursuant to the terms. 
Any joint obligator has the right to cancel this Agreement by notifying us in writing. 
Cancellation does not relieve any obligor of liability for any and all charges incurred 
prior to cancellation. Each obligator is at all times responsible for all amounts 
borrowed by any authorized user(s). Authorized users and other users may also 
be required to repay the amount owed for charges they make; however, you 
remain, at all times, primarily responsible for all amounts owed."
105,34,"Others Using Your Account. If you allow anyone else to use your Account, you 
will be liable for all credit extended to such persons. You promise to pay for all 
purchases and advances made by anyone you authorize to use your Account, 
whether or not you notify us that he or she will be using it. If someone else is 
authorized to use your Account and you want to end that person's privilege, you 
must notify us in writing, and if he or she has a Card, you must return that Card 
with your written notice for it to be effective."
105,35,"You agree that all borrowers and authorized users may have access to information 
regarding transactions on your Account, (including but not limited to) purchases 
and cash advances, Account balances, Account history, payments, and other 
information"
105,36,"Ownership of Card. Your Card remains our property and may be cancelled by us 
at any time without notice. You agree to surrender your Card and to discontinue 
use of the Account immediately upon our request."
105,37,"Electronic Disclosures, Statements, Agreements, and Notices. You 
specifically agree that we may provide all disclosures, statements, agreements, 
notices, amendments, revisions and other documents electronically."
105,38,"Interest Charges on Account Balance. An Interest Charge computed on a daily 
periodic rate will begin to accrue for new Purchases, if you do not pay the new 
balance in full within 25 days after the billing date of the statement on which the 
new Purchases first appear. An Interest Charge computed on a daily periodic rate 
will begin to accrue on the transaction date of purchases (unless the grace period 
applies), cash advance(s), and balance transfers, and will continue to be imposed 
until you have paid any outstanding balance in full. The Credit Union calculates the 
Interest Charge as follows:"
105,39,"The Interest Charge will be figured by applying the daily periodic rate indicated on 
the Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement to the average daily balance of 
purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers multiplied by the number of 
days in the billing cycle. The daily periodic rate and annual percentage rate (APR) 
to be used is determined by the account type approved by us pursuant to the 
terms of your application. The APR for purchases, cash advances, and balance 
transfers may vary on a monthly basis. We will calculate the variable APR by 
adding a margin to the rate disclosed as the U.S. Prime Rate reported in the 
""Money Rate"" table of the Wall Street Journal (paper version) on the third Tuesday 
each month of the year. The new variable rate will be applied to all existing 
balances not paid in full after any applicable grace period. The variable rate will not 
be higher than 18% or as otherwise ordered by the National Credit Union 
Administration (NCUA) Board. Your variable rate will be disclosed to you in each 
monthly statement."
105,40,"Fees. In addition to the Interest Charges set forth above, you agree to also pay 
any and all fees that you incur as disclosed to you on your Truth- in- Lending

Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.

When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 
Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received 
your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 
Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or

105,68,"Outstanding Balance and Payment: ""Outstanding Balance"" means the outstanding loan balance as of the date a Protected Event occurs. ""Payment"" means 
the minimum monthly loan payment scheduled under your loan agreement. Outstanding Balance and Payment both refer to the protected amount under the 
Plan and include principal, interest, the Plan fee and any amounts which the creditor and borrower agreed to finance as part of the loan at the time the credit is 
extended. It does not include late fees or other fees; real estate taxes or property insurance premiums; or any amount that represents defaults in scheduled 
payments of either interest or principal. A scheduled lump- sum Balloon payment will only be protected if the Protected Event cancels the Outstanding Balance. 
Additionally, any advance taken during any period of Involuntary Unemployment or Disability will not be protected and the payment for that advance will not be 
cancelled. You will be responsible for re-paying any amounts that are not cancelled."
105,69,"Pre-existing condition: means a condition for which you received or had medical treatment, advice or diagnostic tests either for that same condition or a
related condition within the six-month period immediately prior to the Effective Date and immediately prior to each and every advance taken. However, any
Protected Event resulting from any such condition or a related condition will not be excluded if the Protected Event commences six months or more after the
Effective Date of protection or six months or more after the advance is taken."
105,70,"What is the Plan Fee and how is it collected? The Plan Fee is the amount you pay for the Protection. It is calculated by applying the rate per $1,000 of your 
monthly outstanding balance or loan amount and will be charged and collected monthly. For closed-end loans, the fee becomes part of your required monthly 
loan payment, if you choose that option, or the term of your loan will be extended. For open-end loans, or if Debt Protection is added after the start of your loan, 
the fee may be added to your outstanding balance as an advance each month without increasing your minimum monthly payment due. This may increase the 
time it takes to fully re-pay the loan and interest will accrue on the debt protection advance. If you fail to pay the fee, we can cancel the protection or, at our 
option, add the fee to your outstanding balance upon which it will accrue interest. Such addition may extend the term of your loan."
105,71,"Can the Plan Fee and terms of this Agreement Change? Yes. We can change the terms of this Agreement, including the rates, at any time. If we do so, you 
will be provided prior notice and an opportunity to cancel your Agreement under the Plan. 
Can this Agreement be contested? Yes. If we find that you did not meet the eligibility requirements at the time of your application, your protection under the 
Plan will be removed, you will receive a refund of fees paid, and an otherwise valid claim will be denied."
105,72,"What does Disability mean and how do I qualify for Disability? 
Disability means your continuous inability, due to sickness or injury, to perform the substantial and material duties of your regular occupation and you are under 
the regular care and treatment of a licensed physician or licensed health care provider. To qualify for Disability protection, you must be disabled for 30 
consecutive days. Benefits begin to accrue on the thirty-first (31st ) day that you are disabled."
105,73,"What amounts will be cancelled under the Disability protection? 
For each occurrence of Disability, we will cancel 1/30th of the Payment for each day that you are disabled beginning with the thirty-first (31st) day of Disability 
and continuing for up to six (6) Payment cancellations. However, cancellations will immediately cease if you recover or return to work; or if the loan is paid off, 
is refinanced, or is discharged for any reason. Cancellation is limited to a total of $15,000 over the term of the loan per each protected Borrower, regardless of 
the number of occurrences. The maximum monthly cancellation is $1,000."
105,74,"We will cancel 1/30th of the Payment for each day you are involuntarily unemployed, beginning with the thirty-first (31st) day of Involuntary Unemployment and 
continuing for: (a) up to six (6) Payment cancellations per occurrence of Involuntary Unemployment or (b) until you discontinue receiving unemployment 
benefits for any reason or (c) you regain employment; whichever is earlier. Cancellation is limited to no more than $15,000 over the term of the loan per each 
protected Borrower, regardless of the number of occurrences. The maximum monthly cancellation is $1,000."
105,75,"(1) is due to suicide committed within the first 2 years of protection; (2) is due to an intentionally self-inflicted injury; (3) is due to a Pre-existing Condition; (4) 
results from war or any act of war, whether declared or undeclared; or (5) occurs on or after your 70th birthday."
105,76,"the disability is related to a normal pregnancy, normal childbirth, or elective abortions. Complications due to pregnancy or childbirth will only be protected if the 
complications themselves are the cause of the disability."
105,77,"(1) your job is terminated because: (a) you retire; (b) you quit or resign your employment for any reason; (c) you lose your employment due to: (i) willful or 
criminal misconduct; (ii) a normal, routine or seasonal shut-down; (iii) discharge from active military service; (iv) disability caused by sickness or injury; or (v) a 
strike, lockout, or labor dispute; (2) the involuntary unemployment commences within 90 days after your Effective Date; or (3) you received unemployment 
benefits within 2 years prior to applying for the Plan."
105,78,"To obtain benefits under the Plan, you must notify us of a Protected Event within 30 days or as soon as possible, but no later than six (6) months after the 
occurrence of the Protected Event, and provide any documentation or information required by us at the time of your claim and/or throughout the period for 
which Payments are being cancelled. You must be able to verify the Protected Event to our satisfaction. If your delay in filing a claim prevents us in any way 
from determining eligibility under the Plan, no benefit will be issued."
105,79,"If you are disabled (""original occurrence"") and sustain an additional sickness or injury which would be in and of itself disabling, the additional sickness or injury 
will not be considered a new occurrence of Disability, but rather will be considered the same occurrence. This means that you will receive benefits only if you 
did not exhaust your maximum per-occurrence benefits in connection with the original occurrence."
105,80,"If you incur a claim for the same type of Protected Event again within six (6) months after you have recovered or returned to full-time work, we will consider this 
a continuation of the prior event. (For disability, however, this only applies if you are disabled due to the same condition.) This means that the maximum 
number of cancellations per occurrence for the prior event will still apply; if that maximum was already reached, no benefits will be issued. If you incur a claim 
for the same type of Protected Event again more than six (6) months after you have recovered or returned to full-time work, we will consider this a new event 
and the terms and conditions of the Plan apply as if no prior event occurred. This provision applies whether you return to work full-time with the same or 
different employer."
105,81,"During the time it takes to process your request for benefits, you are responsible for making your monthly payment by the due date. Once benefits begin, you
are responsible for any difference between the minimum payment due on the loan and the amount that is cancelled"
105,82,"How can the Plan be terminated? 
You may terminate this Agreement at any time by writing us at Arizona Federal Credit Union, P.O. Box 60070, Phoenix, Arizona 85082-0070. If you do so within 
thirty (30) days of your enrollment in the Plan, we will credit your loan account for any fees charged for this protection. We can terminate this Agreement by 
giving you written notice at least thirty (30) days in advance of the termination. Termination by us or you will be effective on the first of the month following 
termination. Fees for the month in which notice of termination is received will still be due and collected from the loan payment"
105,83,"Your Plan participation will terminate without advance notice if: (1) your loan is paid off, refinanced, or discharged for any reason; (2) required loan payments
are past due by 90 days or more; (3) you fail to pay the Plan Fee; (4) both protected Borrowers reach age 70 or die; or (5) the protected Outstanding Balance is
paid off under the terms of the Plan or all maximum cancellations are reached. If you bring your loan current after your Protection has been terminated for
delinquency, protection will not be reinstated automatically and you must re-apply for the Plan."
105,84,"What are the tax implications? 
You may be subject to federal, state and local taxes on the amount of your cancelled loan payment or balance. You should consult your tax advisor. We or the

balance, plus any portion of the Minimum Payments shown on prior statement(s) 
which remains unpaid, plus any amount that exceeds Your approved Credit Limit."
107,17,"If Your payment is more than 7 
days late, You will be charged the greater of 20.00% of the interest due or $35.00."
107,18,"You will be charged 
the following fees associated with the use of Your Account: (a) $32.00 for any check 
(or other negotiable instrument used for payment) which is returned unpaid; and (b) a 
$10.00 overdraft transfer fee FINANCE CHARGE for each such transfer You obtain."
107,19,"A Finance Charge will be 
assessed on any unpaid principal balance for each Feature Category of Your Account 
for the period such balance is outstanding. Balances change each time advances are 
made, payments are made or credits given under any Feature Category. The Finance 
Charge begins to accrue on the date of each advance and there is no grace period"
107,20,"For 
all Feature Categories except Mastercard, the Finance Charge is determined by 
multiplying Your unpaid balance at the close of each day in the billing cycle being 
accounted for by the applicable Daily Periodic Rate. The unpaid balance is the balance 
each day after payments, credits, and unpaid Finance Charges to that balance have 
been subtracted and any new advances, or other charges have been added to Your 
unpaid balance. These daily Finance Charges are then added together and the sum is 
the amount of the Finance Charge owed for the Feature Category being accounted for. 
The total Finance Charge You owe on Your Account for each billing cycle is the sum of 
all the Finance Charges due for all applicable Feature Categories."
107,21,"In the case of any Credit Card transactions 
under Your Platinum Classic Mastercard, World Mastercard, or Platinum Secure 
Mastercard Feature Categories, the balances subject to the periodic Finance Charge 
are the average daily transactions balances outstanding during the month (including 
new transactions)."
107,22,"To get the average daily balance, We take the beginning balance each day, add any 
new balance transfers, cash advances, insurance premiums, debit adjustments or other charges and subtract any payments, credits and unpaid Finance Charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle 
and divide them by the number of days in the billing cycle. The Finance Charge for a 
billing cycle is computed by multiplying the average daily balance subject to a Finance 
Charge by the Monthly Periodic Rate."
107,23,"You can avoid Finance Charges on purchases by paying the full amount of the entire 
balance owed each month within 25 days of your statement closing date. Otherwise, 
the new balance of purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are 
posted to Your Account, will be subject to a Finance Charge. Cash advances and 
balance transfers are always subject to a Finance Charge from the later of the date 
they are posted to Your Account or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the 
cash advance is posted to Your Account"
107,24,"MASTERCARD VARIABLE RATE. All credit advances are subject to a Variable Rate 
which is based on the highest Prime Rate as published in the Money Rates section of 
The Wall Street Journal in effect on the 25th day of each calendar month of each year 
(""Index"") plus Our Margin. The Index plus the Margin equals the Interest Rate. 
Changes in the Index will cause changes in the Interest Rate on the first day of the 
billing cycle in the calendar month immediately following any such change in the 
Index. Increases or decreases in the Interest Rate will cause like increases or 
decreases in the Finance Charge and will affect the number of Your regularly 
scheduled payments. Your Interest Rate will never be greater than 18.00% and will 
apply to Your remaining principal balance."

109,30,"We will not charge both a late payment fee and a returned payment fee in the same billing cycle. 
(iv) We may increase your interest charges and fees as described in Section 4(j) or in the related documents."
109,31,"Minimum Payment. 
(i) Your statement will provide instructions for making payments, including the amounts due and the due date. If applicable, your statement will also 
provide a minimum payment amount. To avoid a late payment fee, your minimum payment must be received by us no later than 10 days after your 
scheduled payment due date. 
(ii) In addition to the minimum payment, you may pay all or part of the balance on your account. However, you must still pay at least the minimum 
payment amount each month, even if you paid more than the minimum on the previous statement. We will continue to charge interest charges during 
billing cycles when you carry a balance regardless of whether your statement includes a minimum payment. If your account is 60 days past due the entire 
balance is immediately due and payable. 
(iii) Payments will be applied in the following order: (A) interest charges; (B) previous cash advances (including transfers); (C) previous purchases; (D) current 
cash advances (including transfers); and finally, to (E) current purchases."
109,32,"The index is the highest Prime Rate published in the “Money Rates” column of The Wall Street Journal (""WSJ""). 
(ii) We may adjust the index monthly using the Prime Rate published in the WSJ on the 25th day of each month, or the day immediately preceding 
those dates on which the WSJ is published if the WSJ does not publish a Prime Rate on the 25th day of a month. The new rate will take effect 
on the first day of your next billing cycle. The WSJ Prime Rate in effect on December 25, 2020 was 3.25%. The APR will be determined by 
adding the margin of 17.74% to the value of the index. Your APR may change monthly."
109,33,"Penalty Rate. If your minimum payment is not received within 60 days of the payment due date, your entire account balance is subject to the penalty 
rate of 24.99% APR. The Penalty APR will remain in place until you make six (6) consecutive minimum monthly payments when due, as indicated 
on your monthly account statement. After six (6) consecutive payments, the APR will revert to the standard APR as shown on the Account Opening 
Disclosure for Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Advances. If you do not make these six (6) consecutive minimum payments, we may keep the 
Penalty APR on your account indefinitely"
109,34,"Variable Rates. How do you calculate variable rates? 
(i) We calculate variable rates by adding a margin to the value of the index. Therefore, variable interest rates may change when the value of the 
index changes. If the index value changes, your new interest rate (and corresponding APR) will take effect on your next billing cycle. 
(ii) What are the daily periodic rates used to calculate my interest? The daily periodic rate for all transactions is 0.0575%. 
(iii) How is the interest charge applied? Subject to your right to pay the “New Balance” in full by the due date without incurring interest charges, interest charges 
accrue from the transaction date, the date the transaction is posted to your account, or the first calendar day of the billing cycle, as applicable. Interest 
charges accrue on the unpaid amount until it is paid in full. This means you may owe interest charges even if you pay the entire “New Balance” one 
month but did not do so for the previous month."
109,35,"How do you calculate interest charges? We calculate your total interest charge by multiplying your average daily balance by the daily periodic rate and multiplying the result by the number of days in the billing cycle. Due to rounding or a minimum interest charge, this calculation may vary slightly from the interest 
charge actually assessed. 
(v) We determine your daily periodic rate by dividing the corresponding APR by 365 and rounding to the nearest 1/1,000 of 1%, not to exceed the maximum 
allowed by applicable law. If the daily periodic rate and corresponding APR increase, the interest charge will increase, and your minimum payment may be more. 
(vi) To determine your average daily balance, add the daily balances together and divide the sum by the number of days in the billing cycle."
109,36,"To determine your daily balance, take the beginning balance and add in new transactions and the periodic interest charge on the previous day’s balance, then 
subtract any payments and credits as of that day. However, if you paid your previous month’s balance in full (or if your balance was zero or a credit 
amount), new transactions are not added to the daily balances as long as the “New Balance” is paid in full by the due date"
109,37,"You may be liable for the unauthorized use of the card that occurs before you notify us of such use. Your liability will not exceed $50.00 or the amount of money, 
property, labor, or obtained by unauthorized use before you notify us, whichever is less. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us 
and we have a reasonable opportunity to act on such notice. In no event shall we be obligated to reissue a lost or stolen card. You agree that we may monitor 
and/or record all telephone communications between you and us."

the time you open your account and as may be changed from time to time in 
accordance with applicable law. Average Daily Balance including new

outstanding during the month. To get the average daily balance, we take the 
beginning balance each day, add any new purchases, cash advances, 
balance transfers or other advances, and subtract any payments, unpaid 
interest charges, and unpaid late charges. This gives us the daily balance. 
Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide that by 
the number of days in the billing cycle. We then multiply that by the periodic 
rate corresponding to the Annual Percentage Rate on your account. If you 
have different rates for purchases, cash advances or balance transfers, 
separate average daily balances for each will be calculated and the 
appropriate periodic rate is then applied to each."

credit card account do not qualify."

113,24,"CHANGES TO BENEFITS: Any benefit, reward, service or feature offered may change or be discontinued at any time for 
any reason. Separate terms and conditions will describe any exceptions."
113,25,"VISA VARIABLE RATE PROGRAM: This section explains how we calculate rates and interest charges applicable to your account. Your variable APR information is shown in Part 1 including any promotional or introductory APR that may apply when your account is opened. We use annual percentage rates (APRs) to calculate interest charges on your account. Our VISA program is a variable rate program, which means that your APR may increase or decrease each billing cycle while you maintain your account with us."
113,26,"The standard variable APR is subject to change each billing cycle based on an increase or decrease in the Prime Rate 
(Index). The Prime Rate (Index) is the highest Prime Rate (Index) published in The Wall Street Journal. In the event that 
the Prime Rate (Index) ceases to be published, changes in your APR will be provided to you on your periodic statement or 
through a separate notice. We calculate your APR for transactions by adding an amount, which we call the margin, to the 
Prime Rate (Index) in effect the last day of the billing cycle. You can find the margin, your initial Prime Rate (Index), daily 
periodic rate and corresponding APR we use for your account in the Account Opening Disclosure."
113,27,"Your APR will increase if the Prime Rate (Index) increases and decrease if the Prime Rate (Index) decreases. If your APR 
increases, then your interest charges and minimum payment due may increase. If the Prime Rate (Index) changes, we will 
apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the billing cycle on your periodic statement when we take the Prime 
Rate (Index) from The Wall Street Journal. The new APR will apply to existing balances and balances added to your account 
after the change."
113,28,"There is no minimum or maximum APR that can apply during the term of this Agreement. There are no annual (or other) 
limitations on changes to the APR during the term of this Agreement. Purchases, balance transfers and cash advances are 
all subject to the same APR. The daily periodic rate is determined by dividing the APR by 365 and will change when the 
APR changes."
113,29,"PROMOTIONAL OR INTRODUCTORY RATE APR: From time to time and at our discretion, we may offer you a promotional APR for all or any part of your account balance, balance transfer or future transactions. The period of time for which the promotional APR applies may be limited. Any applicable promotional APR, the corresponding periodic rates, and the period of time during which they are in effect will appear on the offer. Any promotional rate offer will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement."
113,30,"PENALTY ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE: If you have a late or returned payment that causes your account to be sixty 
(60) days past due, we may apply a penalty APR to your account. If you have an introductory or promotional APR at the 
time your account is sixty (60) days past due, your introductory or promotional APR will be terminated and your penalty APR 
will apply. We determine your penalty APR based on your creditworthiness. We will provide you notice of such penalty APR 
prior to the effective date of the penalty APR."
113,31,"The penalty APR will apply to all outstanding balances and future transactions that occur more than fourteen (14) days after 
we provide you notice of the penalty APR increase. The penalty APR will continue to apply until you make six (6) consecutive 
minimum monthly payments when due beginning with the first (1st) payment due after the effective date of the increase. 
After you make six (6) consecutive minimum monthly payments the penalty APR will no longer apply to those balances. If 
you do not make six (6) consecutive minimum payments on or before the payment due date, we may keep the penalty APR 
on your account indefinitely."
113,32,"INTEREST CHARGES: Interest charges will be imposed on transactions only if you elect not to pay the entire account 
balance shown on your periodic statement for the previous billing cycle by the payment due date shown from the closing 
date of that statement. If you elect not to pay the entire account balance shown on your periodic statement by the payment 
due date, interest charges will be imposed on the unpaid average daily balance of transactions from the previous statement 
closing date and on the new transactions from the date of posting to your account during the current billing cycle, and will 
continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire account balance is paid 
in full"
113,33,"We calculate interest on your account each billing cycle by applying the daily periodic rate to the average daily balance 
(including new transactions). The following explains how we do this. To get the average daily balance of purchase 
transactions"
113,34,"This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number 
of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. Your balances, and their corresponding APRs, are 
shown on your periodic statement."
113,35,"GRACE PERIOD: You will not pay any interest on transactions if you pay the account balance in full by the payment due 
date shown on your periodic statement each billing cycle. We call this a grace period. Generally you will have at least a 
twenty-one (21) day grace period from the close of each billing cycle to pay the account balance without incurring additional 
interest charges provided that either: 1) we received payment in full of the ending balance for the previous billing cycle by 
the payment due date disclosed in the periodic statement for the previous billing cycle; or 2) the ending balance of the 
previous billing cycle was $0. If you have a grace period to pay the account balance for any billing cycle, and do not pay the 
account balance in full during this grace period, interest charges will be assessed on any portion of the account balance not 
paid during the grace period using the average daily balance method as explained above. The payment due date disclosed 
on each periodic statement provided to you is the last day of your grace period for that statement’s billing cycle."
113,36,"Foreign Transaction 
Fee 
1% of each transaction in U.S. dollars 
(transactions made in foreign currency) or 
0.8% of each transaction in U.S. dollars 
(transactions made in foreign currency, 
billed in U.S. dollars) 
See section entitled “Foreign Transactions” 
below for additional details."
113,37,We have the right to charge you a late payment fee of $15 if you do not pay at least an amount equal to the minimum monthly payment within fifteen (15) days after the date the payment is due. The amount of the late payment fee will never be higher than your minimum monthly payment.
113,38,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS: Purchases, cash advances, and credits made in foreign currencies will be billed to your account in U.S. dollars. The conversion to U.S. dollars will be made in accordance with the Visa operating regulations for international transactions. In the event that an international transaction is converted to U.S. dollars the exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions will be: 1) a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives"
113,39,"2) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The rate in effect on the applicable processing date may differ from the rate on the date you used your card. When a credit to the account does not fully offset a charge to the account due to changes in the rate, you are responsible for the difference. For purchases, cash advances, and ATM and non-ATM cash transactions, we will charge a foreign transaction fee in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the amount of the purchase, cash advance or credit, if the transaction requires a currency conversion, or 0.8% of the amount of the purchase, cash advance or credit, if the transaction is made in a foreign currency but billed in U.S. dollars. The above fees for the billing cycle will be shown on your periodic statement."
113,40,"MINIMUM PAYMENT: Every month, you must pay at least the minimum payment due by the payment due date shown on 
your periodic statement. The minimum payment due will be 3.00% your account balance, but not less than $25.00; or your 
account balance if it is less than $25.00. In addition, you must pay any amount past due, plus any amount over the credit 
limit."
113,41,"APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS: We decide how to apply your payments, to the balances on your account. We may apply 
the minimum monthly payment amount first to interest charges, then to the balance with the highest APR and then to 
balances with lowest APRs."
113,42,"PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS: You must follow the instructions below when making a payment. If you do, we will credit the 
payment to your account as of the day we receive it."

due, you must continue to make minimum payments in future months. Any partial payment of your account balance will not 
advance your next payment due date(s). You understand and agree that any payment that (a) delays or (b) accelerates the 
repayment of your account balance will (a) increase or (b) decrease your daily periodic interest charge."
113,47,"PAYMENTS BY AUTOMATIC TRANSFER: By separate Agreement, you may authorize us to automatically transfer the 
minimum payment due from your Credit Union savings or checking account. If you request payment by automatic transfer,

funds from the deposit account, we will close your account. If you gave us a security interest in a deposit account, we may 
use the deposit amount to pay any amount you owe."
113,64,"REFUSAL OF THE CARD: Most transactions require approval of funds, which result in placing a hold against the credit 
limit. We do not guarantee approval of transactions. We are not liable for those that are not approved, even if you have 
enough available credit on your account. If we detect unusual or suspicious activity, we may suspend your credit privileges. 
We may also limit the number of transactions approved per day. We may, although we are not required to, approve 
transactions above your available credit limit."
113,65,"MERCHANT FEES: Some merchants, including merchants outside the U.S., may charge you a fee to use your card for a 
purchase. The fee will be either a percentage of the amount of your purchase or a flat fee, and will be added to the amount 
of your purchase. Usually, a merchant will tell you about this fee before you use your card, but not always. We do not control 
these fees and we cannot prevent them."
113,66,"RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS: A merchant refund to your account will post to your account as a credit. We do not 
control when a merchant sends an account credit. We will choose how to apply the credit to your existing account balance. 
If a credit fails to post to your account, you may request our help in having the credit applied to your account by sending us 
a copy of the credit receipt issued by the merchant. You have the sole responsibility to obtain written proof of credit and to 
retain copies of credit receipts until the credit is properly applied to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what 
you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future transactions, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it on your 
written request or automatically after six (6) months."

or to conduct balance transfers up to the amount of your credit limit. Use of convenience checks to purchase goods and 
services or to obtain cash up to the amount of your credit limit is considered a cash advance on your account. The Credit Union will charge interest beginning as of the date the Credit Union receives the convenience check. You cannot avoid 
paying interest on convenience check transactions. Any special rules applicable to credit card purchases described in this 
Agreement or any other features pertaining to card purchases do not apply to convenience checks."

be provided at the time payment is made."
113,71,"You understand and agree that convenience checks are ineligible for conversion 
to an ACH debit and if presented by a merchant to us for payment, we are required to reject and return the entry. Using 
convenience checks for payments to merchants who have notified you of their intent to convert your check to an ACH debit 
may result in merchant returned item fees and/or late charges. You further understand and agree that you may not attempt 
to authorize a one-time advance from your account via ACH by providing check information (such as the routing, account, 
and serial numbers) to a merchant or other payee in person, via the Internet or by telephone for the purpose of having such 
merchant or other payee electronically initiate a funds transfer. The Credit Union will not be liable for any fees you incur as 
a result of the Credit Union’s failure to honor a convenience check that is converted to an ACH debit."

This provision limiting your liability does not apply to Visa Business card transactions, ATM cash disbursements processed 
on non-Visa or non-Plus networks, or non-Visa PIN-less debit transactions. Additionally, your liability with respect to 
unauthorized transactions may be greater than the above zero ($0.00) liability limit, to the extent allowed under applicable

identify the merchant, electronic terminal, or financial institution at which transactions were made, but sales, cash advance, 
credit, or other receipts cannot be returned with the statement. You agree to retain the copy of such receipts furnished at 
the time of the transaction in order to reconcile your statement. If you request a copy of any sales draft or similar document,

day of each month. If the Journal is not published on that day, then see 
the immediately preceding edition."

on Purchases (unless your Account is subject to a Grace Period, see 
“GRACE PERIOD” section of this agreement), Balance Transfers, and 
Cash Advances on the transaction date, and will continue to accrue until 
you pay the entire New Balance in full. The Interest Charges that accrue 
up to that billing cycle’s statement closing date will be shown on the 
Monthly Periodic Statement for that billing cycle."
114,30,"To calculate Interest Charges each billing cycle, we will: 
• determine your monthly periodic rate (“MPR”) by dividing the 
applicable APR by 12; then 
• multiply the Average Daily Balance for that balance category by 
the MPR."
114,31,"GRACE PERIOD FOR PURCHASES. You may have an interest-free 
period (“Grace Period”) to repay your balance for Purchases before 
Interest Charges are imposed."
114,32,"We will not charge you interest on new Purchases when: 
• your New Balance shown on your Monthly Periodic Statement 
for the previous billing cycle is paid in full by the Payment Due 
Date; 
• your Previous Balance is zero; or 
• your Previous Balance is a credit balance."
114,33,"If none of these conditions occur, Interest Charges will be imposed on 
Purchases from the date they are posted to your Account. The next time 
you pay your entire New Balance in full by the Payment Due Date, the 
Grace Period will apply to new Purchases in the billing cycle they are 
made. The next billing cycle in which you pay your entire New Balance 
in full by the Payment Due Date, the Grace Period will again apply to 
Purchases."
114,34,"The Grace Period applies to Purchases only. There is no Grace Period 
for Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. There is no time period within 
which to repay Cash Advances or Balance Transfers without incurring 
Interest Charges."

cycle, we take your balance at the start of your billing cycle (Previous 
Balance)"

business day"

• by contacting us by phone utilizing either the Interactive Voice 
Response system (IVR) or Customer Service agent;

demanded amount as part of a settlement"
114,43,"MINIMUM MONTHLY PAYMENT. You must make all monthly payments 
by the Payment Due Date shown on your Monthly Periodic Statement. 
You have the option to pay your Account in full at any time. You may 
choose to pay less than the entire New Balance but not less than the 
Minimum Payment due, unless we require immediate payment of your 
entire outstanding balance in full (see default section). Paying only the 
Minimum Payment due will extend the time it takes you to pay off your 
outstanding balance"
114,44,"MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE CALCULATION. The Minimum Payment 
due is the minimum dollar amount shown on your Monthly Periodic 
Statement that must be paid by the due date that is specifed each month. 
If the New Balance is less than $20.00, the Minimum Payment will equal 
the New Balance. Otherwise, to calculate your Minimum Payment we 
start with any past due amount or over limit amount"
114,45,"We round the amount of the Minimum Payment Due to the nearest dollar. 
The New Balance amount will include Fees that have posted to your 
Account. Fees can include Returned Check Fees, Cash Advance Fees, 
Balance Transfer Fees, or Late Payment Fees (we describe these Fees 
in the “FEES” section of this Agreement). The New Balance, including 
Fees, will be used to calculate the Minimum Payment Due."

117,2,"USING YOUR ACCOUNT — If you are approved for an account, the Credit Union will establish a line of credit for you. 
You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other 
charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will 
not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that 
exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or 
electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled “Statements and Notices”) explaining your right 
to opt in to the Credit Union’s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit."
117,3,"In the event you opt in 
to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a 
method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an 
advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain 
cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your 
account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience 
check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check 
drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor."
117,4,"You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee 
imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request 
orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the 
check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately 
describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the 
exact amount of the check."
117,5,"If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 
14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six 
(6) months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be 
renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a 
check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the 
payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any 
legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, 
damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result 
of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request."

acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening 
Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. 
The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to 
pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you 
will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other 
financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). ("
117,7,"If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal."
117,8,"PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of 
convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You 
also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of

117,9,"PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are 
disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a 
payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to 
applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on 
purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement."
117,10,"The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory 
discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an 
Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to 
the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement."
117,11,"FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge 
for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new 
balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge 
will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of 
purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A 
finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the 
billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date)."
117,12,"The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is 
computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance 
of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract 
any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of 
purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of purchases."
117,13,"For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash 
advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash 
advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash 
advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash 
advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances."
117,14,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your 
account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing 
international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the 
applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated 
rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from 
the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
117,15,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to 
your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your 
account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
117,16,"Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account upon the issuance of 
your card. Each year following, the annual fee will be charged to your account during the same month that you were first 
charged the fee. The fee will be charged each year until your account is closed and paid in full disclosed on the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement."
117,17,"Balance Transfer Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee (finance charge), the

disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set 
forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
117,20,"Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your 
account when a payment is returned for any reason."
117,21,"Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee 
may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is 
made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union)."
117,22,"Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your 
account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service,

replacement card that is issued to you for any reason."
117,24,"PAYMENTS — Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date 
specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new 
balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each 
month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new 
balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all 
outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the 
statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your 
credit limit."
117,25,"PAYMENT ALLOCATION — Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit 
Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of 
the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the 
highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable 
annual percentage rate."
117,26,"SECURITY INTEREST — You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and 
under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a 
specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may 
not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release 
all or part of the pledged amount."
117,27,"Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, 
except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax 
treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are 
in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint 
share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default."

be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement."

that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you 
die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in 
default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default 
if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe."
117,30,"When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance 
without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the 
periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for 
your account may be applied towards what you owe."
117,31,"LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — You agree to notify us 
immediately, orally or in writing, at Credit Card Security Department, PO Box 30035, Tampa, Florida 33630 or telephone

Charges will then continue to accrue until the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance is paid in full by the Payment Due Date or until the date of 
payment if after the Payment Due Date. The Finance Charge for a Billing Cycle is computed by applying the daily Periodic Rate to the Daily Principal Balance of Credit Purchases. Each daily

Purchases posted to your Account, and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your Account, but excluding any unpaid Finance Charges and other fees."

describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the 
exact amount of the check."
121,5,"If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 
14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six 
months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be 
renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a 
check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the 
payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any 
legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, 
damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result 
of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request."
121,6,"USING YOUR CARD — You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute 
acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening 
Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. 
The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to 
pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you 
will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other 
financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). ("
121,7,"In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other 
financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your 
card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number 
(PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that 
you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use 
your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the 
transaction."
121,8,"If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase 
instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your 
account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not 
be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal."
121,9,"PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of 
convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You 
also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or 
another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also 
applies to your account."
121,10,"PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are 
disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a 
payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to 
applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on 
purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement."
121,11,"The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory 
discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an 
Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure 
accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to 
the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement."
121,12,"FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge 
for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new 
balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge 
will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of 
purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A 
finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the 
billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date)."
121,13,"The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is 
computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance 
of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract 
any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of 
purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of purchases."
121,14,"For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash 
advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash 
advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash 
advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash 
advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances."
121,15,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your 
account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing 
international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the 
applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated 
rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from 
the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
121,16,"A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash 
advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes 
on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or 
U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
121,17,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to 
your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your 
account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
121,18,"Annual Fee. If your account is subject to an Annual Fee, the fee will be charged to your account. The fee may be 
charged each year until your account is closed and/or paid in full."
121,19,"Account Set-Up Fee. If your account is subject to an Account Set-up Fee, a fee will be charged when you apply for a 
credit card account."
121,20,"Participation Fee. If your account is subject to a Participation Fee, a fee will be charged when you open an account 
as described on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
121,21,"Additional Card Fee. If your account is subject to an Additional Card Fee, a fee will be charged for each additional 
card issued to you at account opening."
121,22,"Balance Transfer Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee (finance charge), the 
fee as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement will be charged to your account when you transfer a 
balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement. 
"
121,23,"Cash Advance Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Cash Advance Fee (finance charge), the fee 
will be charged to your account when you obtain a cash advance from an ATM, the Credit Union or other financial 
institution."
121,24,"Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance 
charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency"

you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set 
forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
121,26,"Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may 
charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing 
cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent 
cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle."
121,27,"Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your 
account when a payment is returned for any reason."
121,28,"Statement Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Statement Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law and 
when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union, a fee may be charged to your 
account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request."
121,29,"Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your 
account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, 
without paying a fee for delivery."
121,30,"PAYMENTS — Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date 
specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new 
balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each 
month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.00% of your total new 
balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all 
outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the 
statement."
121,31,"The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your 
credit limit. In accordance with applicable law, the Credit Union may not post payments to your account or reflect them in 
your available credit limit on the date they are received. The Credit Union may delay replenishing your credit limit until the 
date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
121,32,"PAYMENT ALLOCATION — Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit 
Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of 
the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the 
highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable 
annual percentage rate."
121,33,"SECURITY INTEREST — You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and 
under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a 
specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may 
not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release 
all or part of the pledged amount."
121,34,"Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, 
except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax 
treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are 
in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint 
share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default."
121,35,"Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never 
be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement."
121,36,"DEFAULT — You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date 
that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you 
die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in 
default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default 
if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe."
121,37,"When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance 
without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the 
periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for 
your account may be applied towards what you owe."
121,38,"LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — You agree to notify us 
immediately, orally or in writing, at 1725 I Street NW, Suite 150, Washington, DC 20006 or telephone (866) 820-3869

liability for unauthorized transactions made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your 
card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00."

122,1,"This Addendum to the Cardmember Agreement reflects variations to our standard form credit card agreement in effect on the last business day of 
the previous calendar quarter that ended on 6/30/2021. Our standard Cardmember Agreement(s) is supplemented with pricing information 
reflected in the document(s) titled “Pricing Supplement” and other terms and/or features that may vary between the different types of credit card 
accounts that we offer as reflected in the below “Addendum to the Cardmember Agreement”. These documents are provided to you for 
informational purposes only. These account terms may not be available after the above date. If you apply and are approved for a credit card 
account with us, your actual account terms will be based on the terms of the offer available at the time that you applied and your Cardmember 
Agreement will be the agreement sent to you when your account is first opened."
122,2,"The following provision is to be added at the end of the last sentence of the “Credit Line/Authorized Usage” paragraph in our standard Cardmember 
Agreement and is applicable to credit card accounts that do not have a preset spending limit:"
122,3,"Because your Account has no pre-set spending limit, we may permit you from time to time at our discretion to make certain charges that cause your 
outstanding balance to exceed your revolving credit line. These charges will be evaluated based on account performance, other credit accounts with us, and 
your experience with other creditors. If we authorize these charges, you must pay, with your Minimum Payment Due, the amount by which your balance 
exceeds your revolving credit line, including amounts due to Purchases, Cash Advances, Interest charges, Fees, or other charges.”"
122,4,"The provisions describing how we calculate your balance subject to interest rate each month, accrual of interest and how to avoid paying interest on 
purchases may vary based on the account type that the applicant applied for and whether the applicant is a resident of Iowa. The following two options 
contain the various provisions that could apply, and one of these options will be reflected in the Cardmember Agreement assigned at account opening:"
122,5,"We use a method called “daily balance (including new purchases)”. We calculate interest separately for each “Balance Subject to Interest Rate”. These 
include for example, Purchases at the current rate, Balance Transfers at the current rate, Cash Advances at the current rate, and different promotional 
balances. Your monthly billing statement shows each “Balance Subject to Interest Rate”."
122,6,"To calculate interest, we first calculate a daily balance for each Balance Subject to Interest Rate. We start with the balance, for that Balance Subject to 
Interest Rate, as of the end of the previous day. We add any interest calculated on the previous day’s balance. (This means interest is compounded daily). 
We add any new Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances to the appropriate balance, subtract any new payments or credits from the appropriate 
balance, and make other adjustments. A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. We then multiply each daily balance by the applicable DPR. We do 
this for each day in the billing period. That gives us the daily interest. We add up all the daily interest for all of the daily balances to get the total interest for the 
billing period."
122,7,"On Purchases, interest begins to accrue as of the transaction date. However, you can avoid paying interest on Purchases in any given billing cycle if you pay 
your Statement Balance in full by the Payment Due Date. For Balance Transfers, interest will accrue from the transaction date which generally will be the day 
we send the Balance Transfer to the payee. For Checks, interest will accrue from the transaction date which generally will be the day the payee accepts the 
Check. For Cash Advances, interest will accrue from the transaction date which generally will be the day you take the Cash Advance. If you are charged 
interest in a billing cycle, we will charge a Minimum Interest Charge (or “Minimum Charge”) on your Account if the total interest charge in that billing cycle is 
less than the amount of the Minimum Interest Charge"
122,8,"If you have a promotional APR offer(s) on your Account, you can avoid paying interest on non-promtional Purchases if you pay, by the Payment Due Date, 
the amount that equals your Easy Pay Payment Amount(s) plus your Statement Balance, minus any promotional Balance Transfer balance or special 
category Purchase (such as an Easy Pay Balance) with a reduced APR, and minus any Deferred Financing Purchase during all but the last billing period of the promotional period. If one or more of the balances on your Account is subject to one of these promotional APR offers, this will be more fully explained on 
your monthly Statement. 
"
122,9,"We use a method called “average daily balance (including new purchases)”. To determine the amount of the interest to be charged on your Account we first 
calculate the “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” separately for Purchases, for Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances. We apply the applicable Monthly 
Periodic Rate to the average daily balances of i) Purchases, ii) Balance Transfers, and iii) Cash Advances."
122,10,"The average daily balances for Purchases, for 
Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances are calculated separately and determined as follows: We take the beginning balances for each balance category 
on your Account each day, add to the respective balances any new transaction, subtract any payments or credits and make any other applicable 
adjustment(s). A credit balance is treated as a balance of zero. Then we take the sum of all daily balances and divide by the number of days in the billing 
period to determine the average daily balance. If you multiply the “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” for each balance category as disclosed on your monthly 
billing statement by the applicable MPRs, the results will be the interest assessed, except for minor variations caused by rounding. We may from time to time 
offer you “introductory,” “special” or “promotional” APR offers. If any are in effect on your Account, we will separately identify the balances to which such offers 
apply on your monthly billing statement. These separate balances and the related interest will be calculated in the same manner as described above."
122,11,"On Purchases, interest begins to accrue as of the transaction date. However, you can avoid paying interest on Purchases in any given billing cycle if you pay
your Statement Balance in full by the Payment Due Date each month. For Balance Transfers, interest will accrue from the transaction date which generally

payee accepts the Check. For Cash Advances, interest will accrue from the transaction date which generally will be the day you take the Cash Advance. If
you are charged interest in a billing cycle, we will charge a Minimum Interest Charge (or “Minimum Charge”) on your Account if the total interest charge in that
billing cycle is less than the amount of the Minimum Interest Charge that is disclosed in the Account Summary Table."
122,12,"If you have a promotional APR offer(s) on your Account, you can avoid paying interest on non-promotional Purchases if you pay, by the Payment Due Date,

124,4,"You may obtain 
credit in the form of Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances by using your Card, your account number, Checks, or other credit devices. You agree

you will not use your Card or Account in connection with any transaction that is prohibited or unenforceable and that if you do engage in such a transaction 
you waive any claim that the charge is uncollectible on the grounds the transaction was prohibited or unenforceable. The Card must be returned to us upon

Foreign Transactions and the Transaction Fees associated with any Foreign Transaction are considered Purchases for interest calculation purposes."
124,13,"Purchase” means the use of your Card or account number to buy or lease goods or services and to make a transaction that is not otherwise a Balance 
Transfer or a Cash Advance. Purchases include Foreign Transactions, Account Fees and any adjustments associated with any Purchase."
124,14,"From time to time we may, at our option, make certain special promotional offers available for certain types of Purchases (""Easy Pay Offers""). Details of the
APR and the promotional repayment terms for any available Easy Pay Offer will be described in the specific offer. For Easy Pay Offers, the minimum
payments during the Easy Pay Offer term are designed to pay the promotional balance in full at the end of the promotional repayment term if on-time
payments are made. Payments are calculated by adding the promotional Purchase balance at the time the Purchase is enrolled in the Easy Pay Offer (each
an ""Easy Pay Balance"") and the amount of projected interest that would accrue on the Easy Pay Balance during the promotional repayment term at the
applicable APR if only on-time minimum payments are made. This amount is then divided by the number of months in the promotional period and rounded up
to the next dollar (each an ""Easy Pay Payment Amount"")."
124,15,"Enrollment of the eligible Purchase in the Easy Pay Offer may take up to 24 to 72 hours after you have accepted the Easy Pay Offer. Prior to enrollment the 
then current non-promotional APR may be applied to the applicable purchase from the transaction date until the actual enrollment date if in that billing cycle 
you incur interest charges on Purchases."
124,16,"If you do not make each required Easy Pay Payment Amount on time during the repayment period and/or there is a remaining Easy Pay Balance at the end

for Purchases on the Account and (ii) be subject to the non-Easy Pay Offer Minimum Payment Due calculation applicable to the Principal Balance described 
in ""Your Minimum Payment Each Month"". The then current non-promotional APR will be applied to the remaining Easy Pay Balance amount on the first day of 
the next billing cycle after expiration of the Easy Pay promotion on any remaining balance. If you accept an Easy Pay Offer, you acknowledge and agree that 
the specific terms of the Easy Pay Offer will modify and become part of this Agreement, and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to the 
Easy Pay Offer."

assessed on your Account and any other charges and fees which you may owe under the terms of this Agreement, whether resulting from 1) physical use of 
your Card or a Check, 2) mail order or telephone, computer or other electronic transaction made without presenting the Card, or 3) any other circumstances 
where you authorize a charge, or authorize someone else to make a charge, to your Account"
124,18,"Each person who has agreed to be responsible on the Account 
is responsible to pay the full amount owed on the Account. If this is a joint Account, we can send statements and notices to either of you. We may require 
that you pay the full amount owed without first asking any other person(s) to pay. Instructions for making payments are on your monthly billing statement. 
Payments that comply with the requirements specified on or with your monthly billing statement, including the time of receipt, will be credited as of the

amounts that you owe under this Agreement."
124,23,"We will notify you of any change, but that change may take effect before you receive the notice. We may 
designate that only a portion of your credit line is available for Cash Advances. If we do and you exceed your line, you will be considered to have 
exceeded your credit line for all purposes of this Agreement. We may limit the authorizations to make Purchase, Balance Transfer, Check, or Cash 
Advance transactions that may be accomplished with your Card or Account. If you are approved for an account that does not have a preset 
spending limit please see the Addendum to the Cardmember Agreement addendum for additional information about your credit line and the usage 
of your Account."

Each Check will contain your Account number and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are printed on it. Each must be completed and
signed in the same manner as a regular personal check. If we provide Checks to you, you may not use them to pay any amount you owe under this
Agreement or under any other account you may have with us. Balance Transfer Checks and Cash Advance Checks are subject to the same rate and other
terms under this Agreement as Balance Transfers and Cash Advances, respectively."
124,25,"Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to Balance 
Transfers include Balance Transfer Checks, all references to Cash Advances include Cash Advance Checks, and all references to use of the Account include 
use of these Checks. At our sole discretion we may elect to not honor a Check if there has been a change in your credit worthiness, your account is not in 
good standing or if the Check may cause your account to exceed the Cash Advance or other applicable credit line on your Account. At our sole discretion we 
may elect to honor a Check after its expiration date. Unlike purchase transactions, there are no charge back rights with regard to Balance Transfer 
and Check transactions."
124,26,"At the end of each monthly billing cycle a statement will be mailed or delivered to you if your Account has a debit or credit balance of more than $1.00 or if
interest or a fee has been imposed. We will not send a monthly billing statement if we deem your Account uncollectible or if delinquency collection
proceedings have been instituted by us sending your Account to an outside collection agency or attorney for collection.

Interest Charge, Returned Payment Fee, and Late Payment Fee that is incurred during the current billing cycle."

instances your Minimum Payment Due may be less than the total fees and interest assessed that billing cycle. At any time you may pay more than the 
Minimum Payment Due up to the full amount you owe us. However, you cannot “pay ahead”. This means that if you pay more than the required Minimum 
Payment Due in any billing cycle or if you make more than one payment in a billing cycle, you will still need to pay the next month’s required Minimum 
Payment Due by your next Payment Due Date."
124,29,"APR for Purchases: The variable rate equals the Prime Rate plus a margin from 10.74% to 22.74%, (this corresponds to a current DPR of 0.0383% to

The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to
pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you

financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your 
card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number 
(PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that 
you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use 
your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the 
transaction."

discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an 
Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure

125,12,"FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge 
for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new 
balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge 
will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of 
purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A 
finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the 
billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date)."
125,13,"The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is 
computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance 
of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract 
any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of 
purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of purchases."
125,14,"For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash 
advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash 
advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash 
advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash 
advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances."
125,15,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your 
account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing 
international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the 
applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated 
rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from 
the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
125,16,"A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including 
purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed 
on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign 
transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with 
the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is 
set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
125,17,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to 
your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your 
account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
125,18,"Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance

you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set 
forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
125,20,"Returned Check Fee/ACH. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your

account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request."

Details can lead to disruptions of recurring payment services and interruptions in the products/services I receive from merchants, subscription

201,10,The FINANCE CHARGE applicable to your Account for Cash Advances and Credit Purchases of goods and services that you obtain through the use of your Card is calculated in accordance with the following method.

If the New Balance shown on your monthly statement for the prior billing cycle is paid in full within 25 days from the closing date of that statement, no FINANCE CHARGES will be imposed during the current billing cycle for Cash Advances posted to your Account during previous billing cycles. The FINANCE CHARGE for a billing cycle is computed by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances by the number of days in the billing cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by new Cash Advances posted to your Account, and subtracting any payments as received or credits as posted to your Account, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES.

Each daily balance of Credit Purchases is determined by adding to the outstanding unpaid balance of Credit Purchases at the beginning of the billing cycle any new Credit Purchases posted to your Account, and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your Account, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES."

202,6,The FINANCE CHARGE applicable to your Account for Cash Advances and Credit Purchases of goods and services that you obtain through the use of your Card is calculated in accordance with the following method.
202,7,"Cash Advances: A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on Cash Advances from the date made or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance is posted to your Account, whichever is later, and will continue to accrue on the unpaid average daily balance of such Cash Advances until the date of payment if paid during the same billing cycle, or until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance is paid in full or until the date of payment if more than 25 days from the closing date. If the New Balance shown on your monthly statement for the prior billing cycle is paid in full within 25 days from the closing date of that statement, no FINANCE CHARGES will be imposed during the current billing cycle for Cash Advances posted to your Account during previous billing cycles. The FINANCE CHARGE for a billing cycle is computed by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Cash Advances, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances by the number of days in the billing cycle. Each daily balance of Cash Advances is determined by new Cash Advances posted to your Account, and subtracting any payments as received or credits as posted to your Account, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. All balance transfers from other loans or accounts as permitted by Issuer, in Issuer’s sole discretion, will be treated as Cash Advances for the purpose of all FINANCE CHARGES."
202,8,"Credit Purchases: A FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on Credit Purchases only if you elect not to pay the entire New Balance shown on your monthly statement for the previous billing cycle within 25 days from closing date of that statement. If you elect not to pay the entire New Balance shown on your previous monthly statement within that 25-day period, a FINANCE CHARGE will be imposed on the unpaid average daily balance of such Credit Purchases from the previous statement closing date and on new Credit Purchases from the date of posting to your Account during the current billing cycle, and will continue to accrue until the closing date of the billing cycle preceding the date on which the entire New Balance is paid in full or until the date of payment if more than 25 days from the closing date."
202,9,"The FINANCE CHARGE for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the average daily balance of Credit Purchases, which is determined by dividing the sum of the daily balances during the billing cycle by the number of days in the cycle. Each daily balance of Credit Purchases is determined by adding to the outstanding unpaid balance of Credit Purchases at the beginning of the billing cycle any new Credit Purchases posted to your Account, and subtracting any payments as received and credits as posted to your Account, but excluding any unpaid FINANCE CHARGES."
202,10,The Monthly Periodic Rate (“MPR”) and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (“APR”) are variable rates that may change in January and July of each year. Issuer will determine the Monthly Periodic Rate and the corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE as follows:
202,11,"Issuer starts with an independent index (the “Index”), which is The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. When a range of rates had been published, the highest rate will be used. Issuer will use an Index value available in the month immediately preceding the month of the annual percentage rate adjustment as determined by Issuer in Issuer’s sole discretion. Issuer will choose the date of any annual percentage rate adjustment in Issuer’s sole discretion; this date may change from time to time. To determine the Monthly Periodic Rate that will apply to your Account, Issuer adds a Margin to the value of the Index. Then Credit Union divides this sum by the number of months in a year (12). To obtain the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, Issuer will multiply the Monthly Periodic Rate by the number of months in a year (12). This result is the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE. Your Monthly Periodic Rate, ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, Margin, minimum Monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and maximum Monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE are based upon your Card type and your Tier. Your Tier is based on upon certain creditworthiness factors which include, but are not limited to, payment history and credit bureau data. Your Margin and your initial Monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be disclosed to you before or at the time the Account and Card are issued in the Initial Rate Disclosure, which is included with this Agreement and incorporated by reference. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, your Margin may also be increased or decreased at any time in Credit Union’s sole discretion based upon certain creditworthiness factors which include, but are not limited to, payment history and credit bureau data. Any change in your Margin will cause a corresponding change in the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE and Monthly Periodic Rate."
202,12,"The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE can change each January and each July with changes in the Index. All changes to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will be effective on the first day of the first billing cycle of January or July as applicable. There is no limit on the amount by which the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE can change during any period or the term of the Account. Your Monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE will not be less than the Minimum Rate applicable to your Tier, regardless of changes in the Index. The maximum ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE that can apply is 18.00% or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less."
202,13,Issuer may offer balance transfers from another loan to your Account from time to time. The Monthly Periodic Rate and ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE for such balance transfers will be disclosed to you before you make any such balance transfer.

203,16,"When Interest is Charged: Interest will be charged if you did not pay the prior month’s ending balance in full by the payment due date.

To calculate the “average daily balance”, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases, advances and fees, and subtract any unpaid interest, payments and credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance”. Billing cycle means the time between two billing statements. To calculate the interest, we multiply the average daily balance by the monthly periodic rate. The monthly periodic rate is calculated by dividing the annual percentage rate of 29.9% by 12 (months). The monthly periodic rate is 2.4917%."

Otherwise, we will charge periodic interest on each purchase and balance transfer from the date of that purchase or balance transfer transaction. For every cash advance we charge interest from the date of that transaction. There is no grace period during which a cash advance can be repaid without incurring an interest charge."
205,38,"Periodic Interest Charge Calculation(s). The interest charged on purchase transactions and balance transfers is calculated separately from the interest charged on cash advances. Those separately calculated interest amounts are then combined to determine the total interest charged for the billing period. For each category of transactions, interest is calculated as follows. (1) First, we determine the “average daily balance” by taking each day’s beginning balance, adding any new transactions, and subtracting any payments or credits. We do not add interest incurred during the billing period. The result is the “daily balance.” We then add all the daily balances for the billing period and divide by the number of days in the billing period. The result is the “average daily balance” (also called the “balance subject to interest charge” on your monthly statement). (2) Second, we multiply the average daily balance by the number of days in the billing period. That number is then multiplied by the daily periodic rate (DPR) for that category of transactions. The resulting number is the interest charged for that category of transactions. If you are charged interest, the minimum interest charge will be no less than $1."
205,39,"ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (“APR”) AND DAILY PERIODIC RATE (“DPR”). The APR and DPR for all transactions are variable rates. The APR for a particular billing period is the sum of the Bank’s “Prime Rate” for that billing period plus a “Margin.” The applicable Margin depends on the type of transaction and the type of credit card Account. Daily periodic interest is calculated using the DPR. The DPR is 1/365th of the APR (or 1/366 in a leap year). The APR and DPR on the Effective Date are disclosed on the card carrier. The actual APR in effect for each billing period, and for each category of transactions, is disclosed in your monthly statement. 11.1 : “Prime Rate” and the “Index”. The Prime Rate is equal to, and varies with, an independent index (the “Index”). The Index is the U.S. prime rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal. For any particular billing period, the Bank’s Prime Rate is the published Index rate for the day that precedes by 6 business days the first calendar day of the calendar month in which that billing period ends (If a range of rates is published for that date, the highest of the rates is used). If the Index becomes unavailable, the Bank may designate a substitute Index in its sole discretion. Your APR and DPR, and the amount of your minimum payment, will increase or decrease as the Index and Bank’s Prime Rate increase or decrease. The resulting changes in your APR and DPR will take effect on the first day of your billing cycle the following month. You acknowledge that the Bank’s Prime Rate does not mean the lowest rate at which Bank makes loans to any of its customers, now or in the future."

206,26,"USING YOUR CARD — You understand that the use of your credit card or credit card account will constitute acknowledgement of receipt and agreement to the terms of the Credit Card Agreement and Credit Card Account Opening Disclosure (Disclosure). You may use your card to make purchases from merchants and others who accept your card. The credit union is not responsible for the refusal of any merchant or financial institution to honor your card. If you wish to pay for goods or services over the Internet, you may be required to provide card number security information before you will be permitted to complete the transaction. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union, from other financial institutions that accept your card, and from some automated teller machines (ATMs). (Not all ATMs accept your card.) If the credit union authorizes ATM transactions with your card, it will issue you a personal identification number (PIN). To obtain cash advances from an ATM, you must use the PIN issued to you for use with your card. You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers and money orders. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal."
206,27,"PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account."
206,28,"PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement."
206,29,"FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of cash advances, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement."
206,30,"The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases."
206,31,"For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances"
206,32,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by MasterCard from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate MasterCard itself receives or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

206,45,"PAYMENTS — Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The minimum payment is 2.00% of your total new balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. In accordance with applicable law, the Credit Union may not post payments to your account or reflect them in your available credit limit on the date they are received. The Credit Union may delay replenishing your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
206,46,"PAYMENT ALLOCATION — Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate."
206,47,"SECURITY INTEREST — You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase.

You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default."
206,49,"Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement."
206,50,"DEFAULT — You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe."
206,51,"When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe."

207,62,"When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error."
207,63,"Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct"
207,64,"While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit"
207,65,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe"

207,67,"Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase."

The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)"
207,69,You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.

After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe the amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent."
208,1,We use a method Called “average daily balance (including new purchases). See your account agreement for more details.
208,2,Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided in your account agreement.
208,3,"In this Agreement and Disclosure Statement the words “I”, “me”, and “my” mean each and all of those who apply for or use California Credit Union Premium Visa, Elite Rewards Visa, and/or School Rewards Visa. “You”, “your”, and “yours” mean California Credit Union (CCU). “Card” means the Premium Visa, Elite Rewards Visa, and/or School Rewards Visa issued to me and any duplicates you may issue. “Account” means my Premium Visa, Elite Rewards Visa, and/or School Rewards Visa with you."
208,4,"By requesting and receiving, signing or permitting others to use a Premium Visa, Elite Rewards Visa, and/or School Rewards Visa issued to me by California Credit Union, I agree to the following terms and conditions and any amendments thereto:"
208,5,"I must qualify for and become a member of CCU. You reserve the right to close my account(s) if my membership in CCU terminates. I agree that at your option you may suspend my rights to member services if I violate the terms of this agreement or any other agreement with me, or if I cause a loss to CCU. Notice: This Document Contains Provisions For a Variable Annual Percentage Rate."
208,6,The Monthly Periodic Rate is determined by dividing The Annual Percentage Rate (determined as set forth below) by 12 and will change when the Annual Percentage Rate changes. The Monthly Periodic Finance Charge for each billing cycle will be the sum of the Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my “Purchase” Balance and the Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my “Cash Advance” Balance and cash advance transaction fees (see explanation below) for the billing cycle. The Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my Purchases Balance is calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance for Purchases (see explanation below) on my account for the billing cycle by the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate. The Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my Cash Advances Balance is calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance for Cash Advances (see explanation below) on my account for the billing cycle by the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate.
208,7,"The Annual Percentage Rate may increase or decrease on the first day of each monthly billing cycle (the “Adjustment Date”) during the term of this Agreement. Any such change will be based on an increase or decrease of the most recent “Prime Rate” as published by the Wall Street Journal and available as of the first Tuesday of the calendar month prior to the Adjustment Date (herein “Index”). If more than one rate is listed under the heading “Prime Rate” in the Wall Street Journal, you shall use the lowest rate for purposes of calculating the Index. In the event that the Wall Street Journal ceases publishing the “Prime Rate”, changes in the Annual Percentage Rate will be related to a comparable Index."
208,8,"For example, the Index in effect on the first Tuesday in January shall be used to calculate the Annual Percentage Rate effective as of the first day of the next billing cycle in February of the same year. The Index in effect on the first Tuesday in February shall be used to calculate the Annual Percentage Rate effective as of the first day of the next billing cycle in March of the same year, and so forth. The maximum Annual Percentage Rate during the term of this Agreement may not exceed the maximum Annual Percentage Rate permitted for California state chartered credit unions at the time of each Annual Percentage Rate change. Decreases in the Annual Percentage Rate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement are mandatory. Increases in the Annual Percentage Rate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement are at your discretion. If the Annual Percentage Rate and corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate increases or decreases the Finance Charge will increase or decrease and the number of payments required to repay the unpaid balance may increase or decrease. Each change in the Annual Percentage Rate and the corresponding Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to any unpaid balance on the effective date of such change as well as to future purchases and advances."
208,9,The conditions under which a Finance Charge will be imposed depend upon whether the transaction is a Cash Advance or a Purchase.
208,10,A Finance Charge will be imposed on the Cash Advances outstanding in my Account whenever the statement of the Billing Cycle being concluded (the “current statement”) reflects Cash Advances outstanding at any time during the Billing Cycle. You will charge a Finance Charge on my Cash Advances from the date they are posted to my Account.
208,11,"You will assess a Balance Transfer Fee for balance transfers. For each of these balance transfers, you will add a Finance Charge equal to 2.0% of the balance transfer amount, but not less than $5. This Finance Charge will be added to the balance transfer balance on my Account."
208,12,"The Finance Charge on Balance Transfers consists of i) Balance Transfer Fees and ii) interest computed at a Monthly Periodic Rate. The Annual Percentage Rate for all outstanding indebtedness and new balances relating to Balance Transfers is the same as the purchase rate for transactions. The current Monthly Periodic Rate and the Annual Percentage Rate for Balance Transfers transactions is the same as the purchase rate for your card. This rate is subject to increase or decrease monthly in accordance with changes in the Prime Rate, as set forth in more detail in the paragraph above on Prime Rate Adjustments. An increase may result in a higher minimum monthly payment"
208,13,"You will assess a Cash Advance Transaction Fee for ATM and bank Cash Advances, and for use of convenience checks and other credit instruments or devices intended for my use in obtaining Cash Advances. For each of these Cash Advances, you will add a Finance Charge equal to 3.0% of the Cash Advance amount, but not less than $5. This Finance Charge will be added to the Cash Advance balance on my Account. The Finance Charge on Cash Advances consists of i) Cash Advance Transaction Fees and ii) interest computed at a by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance.” HOW YOU DETERMINE MY TOTAL FINANCE CHARGE: If payment in full was not received by you for the entire “New Balance” by the Payment Due Date, then you will calculate the Finance Charges on my account by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” on my account for Purchases and to the “Average Daily Balance” on my account for Cash Advances. If payment in full for the entire “New Balance” shown on my statement for the previous Billing Cycle was received by you by the Payment Due Date, I will not be subject to the Finance Charges on the “Purchases” portion (which consists of transactions related to purchases of goods and services) of my account for that Billing Cycle. This is known as a “Grace Period”. However, there is no “Grace Period” for Cash Advances. You will assess Finance Charges on the Cash Advance portion of my account from the date such Cash Advances are posted to my account until the date of payment (even if payment of the entire “New Balance” is received by you by the Payment Due Date). Then, you will take the sum of the Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my Purchases balance and the Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my Cash Advances balance for the billing cycle. This determines my total Finance Charge for the billing cycle. Actual Finance Charges will be shown on my periodic statement. CASH BACK REWARDS (Applies to Elite Rewards Visa.): One percent (1%) of purchases (less returns) posted to my account each year will be rebated. BALANCE TRANSFERS and CASH ADVANCES are not eligible for this program. Rewards (rebates) are paid only on current accounts and awarded each year. Points may accumulate from one year to the next.

SECURITY INTEREST (APPLIES ONLY TO SECURED ACCOUNTS): I grant you a security interest in my Share Savings Account as indicated on the Secured Account Authorization, and I understand that the interest in my Share Savings Account is required by you as a condition for granting me a Secured Account. I agree not to give anyone other than you an interest in my Share Savings Account. I agree not to permit any third parties, other than you, to make withdrawals from my Share Savings Account. I authorize you to place a hold on the account, and I agree that you may refuse to allow any withdrawal or payment from the Share Savings Account, if allowing the withdrawal or payment would cause the amount remaining in the Share Saving Account to fall below the credit limit or outstanding balance, whichever is higher. If I default, you may at any time thereafter and without advance warning to me apply all or part of my Share Savings Account balance to the satisfaction of amounts owed on my Account. If the balance in my Share Savings Account is not sufficient to repay the amounts owed on my Account, I agree to immediately pay the remaining balance. PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS: From time to time, you may offer a promotional Periodic Rate on all or a portion of Cash Monthly Periodic Rate. The Annual Percentage Rate for all outstanding indebtedness and new balances relating to Cash Advances is the same as the purchase rate for transactions. The current Monthly Periodic Rate and the Annual Percentage Rate for cash advance transactions is the same as the purchase rate for your card. This rate is subject to increase or decrease monthly in accordance with changes in the Prime Rate, as set forth in more detail in the paragraph above on Prime Rate Adjustments. An increase may result in a higher minimum monthly payment."
208,14,"Whenever any portion of the amount shown as the Previous Balance in the current statement remains unpaid after the due date shown on the previous statement, a Finance Charge will be imposed on the Purchases reflected in the New Balance on my current statement."
208,15,"However, any new Purchases that are reflected for the first time on my current statement will not be subject to a Finance Charge during the Billing Cycle reflected in the current statement if: (a) I have no Previous Balance on my current statement (b) the payments and credits received by you are at least equal to the Previous Balance that appears on my current statement. All other new Purchases will be “Purchases that are subject to a Finance Charge”."
208,16,"You will charge a Finance Charge on the “Purchases that are subject to a Finance Charge” from the date they are posted to my Account. The minimum Finance Charge, if any, imposed on Purchases posted to the Account will not be less than $0.50."
208,17,"The monthly Periodic Rate and the Annual Percentage Rate 
on Purchase Transactions in effect during any billing cycle is 
determined by adding a margin to the Prime Rate as set 
forth in more detail in the paragraph above on Prime Rate 
Adjustments."
208,18,"Regardless of any other provision in your Agreement to the contrary (including any introductory or promotional rates), you may, when permitted by applicable law, impose a higher monthly Periodic Rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate (a “Default Rate”) to my Account if I fail to pay the total amount due shown on my monthly statement by sixty days (60) after the payment due date."
208,19,"The Default Rate may vary, and is calculated by adding 19.90% to Wall street Journal prime rate to determine my current Annual Percentage Rate. The maximum default rate (CAP) is 23.15%. The Default Rate will take effect on the first day of the Billing Cycle that follows a Triggering Event (failure to pay the total amount due by sixty (60) days after the scheduled due date), and will apply to my outstanding balances in effect and any new Purchase and Cash Advance transactions. The Default Rate will remain in effect until I have paid six consecutive timely monthly payments immediately following the effective date of the increase (the “Default Rate Period”)."
208,20,"We calculate the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of your account (including current transactions). To get the “average daily balance” we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/loans], and subtract any payments or credits, [and unpaid finance charges]. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the 
“average daily balance.”"
208,21,"If payment in full was not received by you for the entire “New Balance” by the Payment Due Date, then you will calculate the Finance Charges on my account by applying the Monthly Periodic Rate to the “Average Daily Balance” on my account for Purchases and to the “Average Daily Balance” on my account for Cash Advances. If payment in full for the entire “New Balance” shown on my statement for the previous Billing Cycle was received by you by the Payment Due Date, I will not be subject to the Finance Charges on the “Purchases” portion (which consists of transactions related to purchases of goods and services) of my account for that Billing Cycle.

You will assess Finance Charges on the Cash Advance portion of my account from the date such Cash Advances are posted to my account until the date of payment (even if payment of the entire “New Balance” is received by you by the Payment Due Date). Then, you will take the sum of the Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my Purchases balance and the Monthly Periodic Finance Charge on my Cash Advances balance for the billing cycle. This determines my total Finance Charge for the billing cycle. Actual Finance Charges will be shown on my periodic statement."

208,25,"I promise to repay you at your office all sums advanced to me or any person I permit to use this account on the terms and conditions set forth herein. Payments will continue until I have paid in full the unpaid balance, Finance Charges and any other fees and charges."
208,26,"Though I need only pay the Minimum Monthly Payment Due, I understand that I have the right to repay my balance at any time without penalty. I also understand I will only be charged Finance Charges to the date I repay my entire balance. I may make larger payments without penalty and this may reduce the total amount of Finance Charges that I will repay. Any partial payment of my balance will not advance my next payment due date(s).

""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
208,43,You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase.
208,44,"If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
208,45,"You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower."
208,46,"Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."

208,48,"CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
208,49,"REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees.

If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance."
208,51,"You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
208,52,"Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us"
208,53,"INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of Your Account, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
208,54,"Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
208,55,"In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
208,56,"Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Mastercard from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Mastercard itself receives or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
208,57,"A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that You complete or a merchant completes on Your Card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

209,15,"Average Daily Balance (including current transactions): We figure the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of your account. To get the “average daily balance” we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid interest or other finance charges and] any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance.”"
209,16,"If we issue you a card, you agree to repay all debts and the FINANCE CHARGE arising from the use of the card and the card account. For example, you are responsible for charges made by yourself, your spouse and minor children or any other authorized user. You are also responsible for charges made by anyone else to whom you give the card, and this responsibility continues until the card is recovered. You cannot disclaim responsibility by notifying us, but we will close the account for new transactions if you so request and return all cards. Your obligation to pay the account balance continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct you or one of the other persons responsible to pay the account. Any person using the card is jointly responsible with you for charges he or she makes. If that person signs the card he or she becomes a party to this Agreement and is also jointly responsible for all charges on the account including yours."

This Line of Credit for cash advances is part of not in addition to your established Line of Credit. You agree not to let the account balance exceed this approved Credit Line. Each payment you make on the account will restore your Credit Line by the amount of the payment which is applied to the principal. You may request an increase in your Credit Line only by written application to us, which must be approved by a loan officer. By giving you written notice, we may reduce your Credit Line from time to time, or with good cause, revoke your card and terminate this Agreement. Good cause includes your failure to comply with this Agreement, or our adverse reevaluation of your creditworthiness.

Every month you must pay at least the Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date.

The Minimum Payment will be (a) 2% of your Total New Visa Balance, or $25.00 whichever is greater, or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $25.00 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid.

209,23,"Default. You will be in default if you fail to make any Minimum Payment within 25 days after your monthly statement closing date. You will also be in default if your ability to repay us is materially reduced by a change in your employment, an increase in your obligations, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving you, your death or your failure to abide by this Agreement, or if the value of our security interest materially declines.

209,26,"Returns and Adjustments. Merchants and others who honor the Card may give credit for returns or adjustments. We will post these to your account.

Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn if you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any 
amounts due on your Account if you should default."
209,29,"Effect of Agreement. This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advance, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms. We may amend this Agreement from time to time by sending you a 45 day advance written notice required by law. Your use of the card thereafter will indicate your agreement to the amendments. To the extent the law permits, and we indicate in our notice, amendments will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. You have the right to reject a change in terms prior to the effective date thereof by calling us toll free at 1-866-273-3281 or by mailing us at: 1380 Market Ave North Canton Ohio 44714. In such case, your account will be terminated or suspended and no further credit will be available to you. You will remain liable to pay the balance then due under the existing terms. The right to reject a change in terms does not apply if we have not received a required minimum payment within 60 days after the due date for that payment."
209,30,"Changing or Terminating Authorized Users. Upon your request, we may issue additional cards for authorized users that you designate.

You agree to provide us from time to time with any information we reasonably request in order to assess your ability to make payments of the Minimum Payment Due based on the current Credit Limit or any contemplated Credit Limit."
212,36,"After the first year of the Account, you may also request a decrease in your Credit Limit to a level not below $200.00 and a reduction in the Deposit Funds in the Pledged Deposit Account to a level not exceeding the reduced Credit Limit. In such event, we will immediately reduce your Credit Limit but you will not receive any Deposit Funds until we are reasonably assured that the remaining Deposit Funds will be sufficient to secure in full all your obligations to us under this Agreement, including your Account balance and obligations relating to authorized Transactions that are not yet reflected in your Account balance (“Pending Transactions”). This may take up to ten (10) weeks in certain circumstances."
212,37,"The amount by which your Credit Limit exceeds the sum of: (i) your outstanding Account balance (including principal, Fees and Interest Charges); (ii) the dollar amount of all Pending Transactions; and (iii) funds you have sent us that are not yet treated as “good” funds under Section 11.(e) for purposes of determining credit availability is referred to as your “Available Credit.” We are not required to approve any Transaction if the amount of the Transaction exceeds your Available Credit. However, we may authorize and pay any such Transaction in our absolute discretion. Whenever the outstanding balance of the Account exceeds your Credit Limit, you agree to pay us the difference on demand."
212,38,"Subject to applicable law, we may from time to time and in our sole discretion increase your Credit Limit to any level of our choice, even if the new Credit Limit exceeds the Deposit Funds in the Pledged Deposit Account. We OpenSky Secured Visa Credit Card Agreement SKY1‐046 Page 4 May 2020 may also decrease your Credit Limit in our sole discretion, as low as $0. Additionally, we may at any time close your Account, or limit the number or amount of Transactions that can be charged to your Account based on an evaluation of various factors. We will promptly notify you in writing in the event we decide to take any such action on your Account"
212,39,"If we close your Account without cause or if we take any action described in Section 6.(e)(i) without cause and you give us written notice within thirty (30) days that you are closing your Account, we will disregard any reduction in your Credit Limit for purposes of determining your Annual Percentage Rate (“APR”). Also, if we reduce your Credit Limit without cause, we will not demand immediate payment of any excess of the Account Balance over the reduced Credit Limit until such time as the reduced Credit Limit first equals or exceeds the outstanding Account Balance"
212,40,"General. Each Billing Cycle, we separately determine the Interest Charges on Purchases and the Interest Charges on Cash Advances. Both for Purchases and Cash Advances (each, a “Balance Type”), we determine Interest Charges each Billing Cycle by multiplying the Balance Subject to Interest Charges (see 7.(c) below) by the daily Periodic Rate and by then multiplying the result by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. For each Balance Type, the Balance Subject to Interest Charges is the Average Daily Balance (including new Transactions), as calculated pursuant to Section 6.(c) below. To get the total Interest Charges each Billing Cycle, we add together the Interest Charges for Purchases and the Interest Charges for Cash Advances"
212,41,"For each Balance Type, the Daily Periodic Rate and APR will equal the sum of a Margin and the Prime Rate determined as of the third Friday of the last calendar month ended before the beginning of the applicable Billing Cycle (the “Determination Date”). The Margin for Purchase and Cash Balance Types is 14.14%. The “Prime Rate” is the highest U.S. Prime Rate as published in the “Money Rates” section of The Wall Street Journal on the Determination Date (or, if The Wall Street Journal does not publish such rate on such day, the previous day it does publish such rate). (If The Wall Street Journal stops publishing the U.S. Prime Rate in its “Money Rates” section, then we may substitute another index and margin, in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law.) For each Balance Type, your rate will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. The Daily Periodic Rate will be 1/365th of the APR rounded to the nearest 1/100,000th of 1%. The Daily Periodic Rate in effect at any time is disclosed on the monthly statement under “Interest Charge Calculation”. The Daily Periodic Rate for your Purchase and Cash APR is 0.04764%.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Daily Periodic Rate and APR will never exceed the maximum rates permitted by applicable law"
212,42,"Your APR may increase. If and when the APR for each Balance Type increases, more Interest Charges will accrue and more of each payment will be applied to Interest Charges and less to principal. This will result in higher and/or more payments if you pay the Minimum Payment Due each month. If and when the APR decreases, less Interest Charges will accrue and less of each payment will be applied to Interest Charges and more to principal. This will result in lower and/or fewer payments if you pay the Minimum Payment Due each month."
212,43,"For each Balance Type, the Balance Subject to Interest Charges is the Average Daily Balance for such Balance Type. The Average Daily Balance for a Billing Cycle equals the sum of the daily Purchases or Cash Advances balances, as applicable, for each day of the Billing Cycle, divided by the number of days in the Billing Cycle"
212,44,"The Purchases balance for each day in the Billing Cycle is computed as follows: (A) For each day (including the first day of the Billing Cycle), we start with the prior day’s closing balance of Purchases, if any. (B) For the first day of the Billing cycle, we add any unpaid Interest Charges on Purchases that accrued during the prior Billing Cycle. (This results in the monthly compounding of Interest Charges.) (C) For each day in the Billing Cycle (including the first day of the Billing Cycle), we add any new Purchases posted to your Account and subtract any payments or credits applied to Purchases. However, we do not subtract a second time any payments or credits that have already been subtracted in step (B) above. (D) We treat any negative daily balance as $0."
212,45,"To get the daily balance of Cash Advances each day: (i) we take the previous day’s balance of Cash Advances (if any); (ii) we add any new Cash Advances; and (iii) we subtract any new payments or credits applied to Cash Advances. For the first day of each Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Interest Charges on Cash Advances that accrued during the prior Billing Cycle. (This results in the monthly compounding of Interest Charges.) If a Cash OpenSky Secured Visa Credit Card Agreement SKY1‐046 Page 5 May 2020 Advance obtained in a Billing Cycle is not posted in that Billing Cycle, we add the Cash Advance to the daily balance on the first day of the next Billing Cycle instead of the day it was obtained. We treat any negative daily balance as $0."
212,46,"Fees. Subject to applicable law, including the federal Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, you paid or agree to pay the following Fees: (a) Set-Up and Maintenance Fees. You paid or agree to pay the following Set-Up and Maintenance Fees: (i) When we open your Account and each year following the anniversary date of your Account opening, we will charge you an Annual Fee of $35.00. (ii) If you requested us to expedite shipping of your Card, you also paid a one-time, non-refundable Expedited Card Fee of $50.00. (b) Transaction Fees; Currency Conversion."
212,47,"Each time you obtain a Cash Advance, we will charge a Cash Advance Fee equal to the greater of $6 or 5% of the dollar amount of the Cash Advance. (ii) If you make a Purchase or obtain a Cash Advance in a foreign currency, the Transaction will be converted into a U.S. dollar amount in accordance with operating regulations or conversion procedures of Visa International (“Visa”) in effect at the time the Transaction is processed. Currently, Visa regulations and procedures provide that the currency conversion rate will be either a wholesale market rate or a government-mandated rate in effect one day prior to the processing date. We charge a Foreign Currency Transaction Fee equal to three percent (3%) of the gross amount of the Transaction in U.S. Currency. The foreign merchant or financial institution may charge a separate fee."
212,48,"Penalty Fees. (i) If we do not receive a payment from you in at least the amount of your Minimum Payment Due within one (1) day after the Payment Due Date shown on your monthly statement, you will be charged a Late Payment Fee up to $27 for the first Late Payment and up to $38 for a subsequent Late Payment within the following six (6) months. (ii) Each time a check, instrument or other payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason or we must return any check or instrument you send us because it is not signed or is otherwise incomplete, we will charge you a Returned Payment Fee of $25.00."
212,49,"Additional Fees. (i) We will charge an Expedited Pay By Phone Fee of $10.00 each time you arrange for an expedited payment by calling us and obtaining the assistance of a live representative or agent of ours. Your payment will be credited to your Account the same day, if received on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on a business day and otherwise on the next business day"
212,50,"We will charge you a Document Retrieval Fee of $5.00 each time you request and we provide you with a copy of any monthly Account Statement (“Account Statement”), sales draft or payment instrument previously provided you, unless the request is made in connection with a written notice of a billing error."
212,51,"We will charge you Paper Statement Fee of $3.00 if you request us to deliver your Account Statements to you in paper through the U.S. Postal Service rather than accessing them online. For more details about delivery of your Account Statements, please refer to Section 10. below."
212,52,"Notwithstanding any language in this Agreement to the contrary, we will limit the total amount of any Transaction Fees (listed on the first page) that we impose during the first year after the Account is opened to twentyfive percent (25%) of your initial Credit Limit (or any lower Credit Limit that may apply during the first year after the Account is opened). If a charge is imposed that would otherwise exceed this limit, then, in accordance with applicable law, we will make the necessary corrections within a reasonable amount of time but no later than the end of the Billing Cycle following the Billing Cycle during which the limit was exceeded."
212,53,"It is not the intention of the parties that anything in this Agreement should result in the assessment of Interest Charges or Fees in excess of those permitted by applicable law. If any Interest Charge or Fee assessed under this Agreement is finally determined to be in excess of that permitted by applicable law, the excess amount will be applied to reduce the outstanding balance in your Account or, if there is no outstanding balance, will be refunded to you."
212,54,"Account Statements. We will send you an Account Statement shortly after the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if your Account has a debit or credit balance in excess of $1.00 at the end of the Billing Cycle or any Interest Charge has been imposed during the Billing Cycle. However, we are not obligated to send you an Account Statement if we deem your Account to be uncollectible or applicable law does not require us to send you an Account Statement for other reasons. Your Account Statements will show Transactions; payments, credits and adjustments; Interest Charges and Fees; the Previous Balance and New Balance on your Account; your Credit Limit and Available Credit; and the Minimum Payment Due and Payment Due Date. As you consented to receive e-disclosures when you applied for this Account, your Account Statements are posted online and can be accessed at MyAccount, our secure online Cardholder Center. At any time you may notify us that you withdraw your consent to receive electronic statements and we will deliver your Account Statements to you in paper through the U.S. Postal Service. However, we will charge you a $3.00 Paper Statement Fee for each Account Statement we deliver to you in paper."
212,55,"(a) Each month, you must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due shown on your Account Statement by the “Cut-Off Time” on the Payment Due Date shown on your Account Statement, which will be at least twenty-five (25) days after the date of the Account Statement, typically on the same day of each calendar month. However, if the Payment Due Date falls on a day we do not receive mail (“non-business day”), we will not treat your payment as late for any purpose if we receive it by the Cut-Off Time on the next day we receive mail (a “business day”). The “Cut-Off Time” is 5:00 p.m. local time at the payment address specified on the Account Statement (or closing time of any of our offices at which you make payment in person)."
212,56,"If the total outstanding balance under your Account at the end of a Billing Cycle, as shown on your Account Statement (the “New Balance”), is less than $25.00, the Minimum Payment Due equals the New Balance. Otherwise, the Minimum Payment Due equals the sum of: (i) any amount past due; plus (ii) any amount by which the New Balance exceeds your Credit Limit; and (iii) the greatest of: (A) the sum of the Interest Charges and Fees reflected on your Account Statement; (B) two percent (2%) of the New Balance; or (C) $25.00."
212,57,"You agree to make all payments by check or other negotiable instrument drawn on a financial institution located in the U.S. or by money order. Payments must be made in U.S. dollars. All payments, except disputed payments, must be mailed or delivered to us at the payment address shown on the front of your Account Statement (the “Payment Address”). Any payments received after the Cut-Off Time on a business day will be credited on the next business day. However, credit to your Account may be delayed for up to five (5) days if we accept a payment that is: (i) not received by mail or messenger service at the Payment Address or in-person at one of our branches; (ii) not made in U.S. dollars by a check or other negotiable instrument drawn on a financial institution located in the U.S. or by money order; or (iii) not accompanied by the top portion of your Account Statement. Delayed crediting may cause you to incur additional Fees and Interest Charges, subject to applicable law. You may not use a Statement Check to pay any amount you owe under this Agreement or any other amount you owe us. None of the following will constitute a payment made by you: (i) a credit posting from a merchant; (ii) a reversal of fees by us; or (iii) our offset of the Deposit Funds in the Pledged Deposit Account."
212,58,"Subject to applicable law, we may apply payments and other credits to your Account in any manner we choose in our sole discretion. For payments up to the Minimum Payment Due, we typically apply payments based on the APR of different balances, first to the lowest APR, next to the next-lowest APR and so on. For payments in excess of the Minimum Payment Due, we apply payments in the reverse order, first to balances with the highest APR."
212,59,All credits for payments to your Card are subject to final payment by the institution on which the item of payment was drawn. Your Available Credit may not be restored for up to twenty (20) days after we receive your payment.
212,60,"Prepayment. At any time, you may pay all or any part of your outstanding Account balance. Payment of more than the Minimum Payment Due in one Billing Cycle will not relieve you of the obligation to pay the entire Minimum Payment Due in subsequent Billing Cycles."

Additionally, this benefit is not available where precluded by law or in violation of the territory terms of the auto rental agreement or prohibited by individual merchants.

307,2,"This Consumer Credit Card Agreement and Disclosure together with the Account Opening Disclosure and any other Account opening documents or any subsequent documents provided to You related to this Account (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Agreement”) govern the terms and conditions of this Account. “We,” “Us,” “Our” and “Ours” and “Credit Union” refers to Community Choice Credit Union with which this Agreement is made. “You,” “Your,” and “Yours” refers to each applicant and co-applicant for the Account; any person responsible for paying the Account; and anyone You authorize to use, access or service the Account. ""Card"" means the Visa or Mastercard® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
307,3,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
307,4,"You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower."
307,5,"Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
307,6,"USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
307,7,"CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
307,8,REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees.
307,9,"Visa Classic, Visa Platinum, Standard Mastercard - For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date."
307,10,"The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance."
307,11,"Visa Platinum - Direct Merchant - For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date."
307,12,"The Minimum Payment Due is 1.60% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance."
307,13,"You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
307,14,"Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
307,15,"INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
307,16,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
307,17,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa or Mastercard as applicable, from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa or Mastercard as applicable, itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
307,18,"Visa Classic, Visa Platinum, Visa Platinum - Direct Merchant - A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
307,19,"Standard Mastercard - A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that You complete or a merchant completes on Your Card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
307,20,"AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no Page 3 of 6 01402665-MXC30-P-1-041519 (MXC303-E) requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
307,21,"INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card."
307,22,"Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
307,23,"PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
307,24,"DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."
307,25,"LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at P.

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
309,3,SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase.
309,4,"If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
309,5,"You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance."
309,6,"Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
309,7,"USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
309,8,"CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
309,9,REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees.
309,10,"For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date."
309,11,"The Minimum Payment Due is 2.30% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance"
309,12,"You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full."
309,13,"If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
309,14,"Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
309,15,"INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — The finance charges (or Annual Percentage Rates) provided within this Agreement are authorized by Florida Statute 687.12, 655, and 516. We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of Your Account, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
309,16,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
309,17,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
309,18,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
309,19,"A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all multiple currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances, and credits to Your Account. A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all single currency foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that You complete or a merchant completes on Your Card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies, or U.S. consulates. Transactions completed by merchants outside of the United States are considered foreign transactions, regardless of whether You are located inside or outside the United States at the time of the transaction. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
309,20,"AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
309,21,"INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card."
309,22,"Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued Page 3 of 5 00903275-MXC30-C-1-062821 (MXC305-E) recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
309,23,"PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."

You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement You have with Us.

In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account."

311,4,"2. THIS IS YOUR CONTRACT WITH US. Once this agreement is provided to you, it becomes a binding contract. When you signed the application, you acknowledged that you would receive a copy of this Agreement and promised to abide by the terms of this Agreement including all applicable laws. This Agreement is a Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement as well as a contract"
311,5,"3. SIGN THE CARD. Your Card(s) have been printed as you have directed. Each Card must be signed (in the space provided on the back) by the person whose name is printed thereon. That signature must be in the same form as printed on the front of the Card. However, your liability under this Agreement does not depend on whether you sign your Card."
311,6,"4. USING THE CARD. By using this Card, you are agreeing to comply with the terms of this Agreement. To make a Purchase or Cash Advance (which includes Balance Transfers), present the Card to a participating MasterCard plan merchant or financial institution and sign the sales draft or cash advance draft (when required) which will be imprinted with your Card or generated after your Card’s number has been magnetically read or otherwise provided. Please note that we are not responsible if a particular MasterCard plan merchant or financial institution refuses to honor your Card.

We will upon request furnish you with a copy of a draft for a charge per copy; however, there will be no charge in cases involving error resolution. You may use your Card to make purchases and cash advances primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In addition, you may obtain cash advances from the Credit Union or from other financial institutions that accept MasterCard Cards or ATMs that accept MasterCard Cards. Whenever you request a transaction, you may be required to prove your identity. When the amount advanced appears on a subsequent statement, that statement reference will be conclusive evidence of the request. To obtain an advance at an ATM you must use a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that was issued for use with the Card."
311,7,"5. CHECKING ACCOUNT INDIRECT ACCESS. If you so choose, when you write a check drawn on your Community Financial Checking Account that overdraws that account, we will add the amount by which your Checking Account is overdrawn to your MasterCard Balance and transfer that amount to your Checking Account to cover the overdraft."
311,8,6. ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS. You agree that you will only use your Account for transactions that are legal where you reside. Display of a payment card logo by an on-line merchant does not mean that the transaction with that merchant is legal where you reside. You agree not to use your Card for any illegal transactions. We will not be liable if you engage in any illegal transactions.
311,9,"7. PROMISE TO PAY. You promise to repay to us all debts and the FINANCE CHARGE thereon arising from any authorized use of the Card. You agree not to let someone else use the card without our consent. If the application was signed by two persons, the Account is joint; that is, each of you, separately and jointly with each other, is liable for all debts on the Account and FINANCE CHARGE(S). Your obligation to pay all such debts and FINANCE CHARGE(S) continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct that only one of you, or some person other than you (or both of you), must pay such debts and FINANCE CHARGE."
311,10,"8. CREDIT LINE. When we approved your application, we established a self-replenishing line of credit for you and notified you of the amount thereof (“credit limit”). You agree not to let your Account Balance exceed such amount, and you agree to pay us the total amount over the credit limit upon our demand whether or not we authorized the advance(s) which caused you to exceed your credit line. Unless you are in default, each payment you make on the Account will replenish your credit limit by the part of that payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in the credit limit by a written application, which must be approved by us. We may increase or decrease the limit from time to time or may, with good cause, revoke your Card and terminate this Agreement; in either event, we will give you written notice of such action. “Good Cause” includes your failure to satisfy the terms of this Agreement or our adverse reevaluation of your Credit worthiness; in either event, we will give you written notice of such action. In the event your account is cancelled or revoked due to default, the balance at the time of default may be transferred in-house with the Credit Union and billed in accordance with applicable law. You may terminate this Agreement, at any time and for any reason, by giving us written notice. Nevertheless, termination by you or by us does not affect your obligation to pay all debts and FINANCE CHARGE thereon arising from authorized use of your Card. The Cards remain our property and you must recover and surrender to us all Cards upon our request or upon termination of this Agreement."
311,11,"9. JOINT ACCOUNTS. If more than one person signed the application, each person who signed it promises to pay all amounts owed to us under this Agreement. Each of you authorizes the other(s) to make purchases, withdrawals, cash advances or balance transfers individually. Any one of you may cancel the Account. The cancellation will be effective to all of you. Each of you is jointly and severally obligated. This means that we may collect money owed to us from each of you or from all of you regardless of your current domestic relationship or other legal proceedings. In any event, all of you will continue to be jointly and severally obligated until all cards are returned and the debt is extinguished."
311,12,"10. AUTHORIZED USERS. You may allow Authorized Users on your Account by notifying us that you want someone added to the account as an Authorized User and obtaining our consent. Additionally, though not allowed, you will be deemed to have personally authorized another user in the following ways (1) by lending your Card or Account Number to another (without our required consent); or (2) by any other means in which you would be legally considered to have allowed another to use your Account or be legally prevented from denying that you did so. Think carefully before you allow someone to become an Authorized User (in any manner). By doing so, you authorize the person to use your Account to the same extent you can, including but not limited to making Purchases, Checking Account Indirect Access, Cash Advances, Balance Transfers and allowing others to use your Account. Your Account does not permit you to limit the nature or amount of authority you give to any Authorized User and you agree that you will not attempt to do so. An Authorized User’s authority will continue until you both notify us that you are terminating the authority and you physically retrieve the Card. If you cannot retrieve the Card, you will remain liable for any transactions we cannot prevent after you notify us"

We will send you a statement every month showing your Previous Balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers, the current transactions on your account, the remaining credit available under your Credit Line, the New Balances of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers, the Total New Balance, the FINANCE CHARGE due to date, and the Minimum Payment required. Every month you promise to pay at least the Minimum Payment on or before the due date shown on your statement. You may, of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full, and you will reduce the FINANCE CHARGE by doing so. The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 3% of your Total New Balance (rounded to the nearest dollar), or $15.00, whichever is greater, or (b) your total New Balance, if it is less than $15.00 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess upon our demand. Any payment check or other form of payment that you send us for less than the full balance due that is marked “paid in full” or contains a similar notation, or that you otherwise tender in full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be sent to the Credit Card Disputes Department, Community Financial, 500 S. Harvey, Plymouth, MI 48170. We reserve all our rights regarding these payments (e.g. if it is determined that there is no valid dispute or if any such check is received at any other address, we may accept the check and you will still owe any remaining balance). We may refuse to accept any such payment by returning it to you, not cashing it, or destroying it. All other payments that you make should be sent to the appropriate payment address."
311,14,"12. PAYMENT ALLOCATION. We may select and change the method by which payments and credits are allocated to your account at our sole discretion; however, payments will be allocated to billed amounts before they are allocated to unbilled amounts (transactions incurred since your last statement) and payments amounts in excess of the required minimum monthly payment will be applied to higher rate balances before they are applied to lower rate balances. Payment for more than the minimum amount due will be accepted as a single payment for the month; the amount over the minimum is not applied toward future payments due."
311,15,"13. FINANCE CHARGE. Your MasterCard Account will be subject to a FINANCE CHARGE (interest) at the periodic rate of _________% per month, which corresponds to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of ________%. If you fail to pay any required minimum payment for more than 60 days after the payment is due, we may increase the monthly periodic rate to 1.500%, corresponding to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 18.00%. This increased rate, once imposed, will remain in effect until you make six consecutive minimum payments on time."
311,16,"The FINANCE CHARGE is calculated by applying the above periodic (monthly) rate to the Average Daily Balance (including new purchases). An “Average Daily Principal Balance” is calculated separately for purchases, cash advances and balance transfers and is determined as follows: For each day during the statement period (billing cycle) the principal balances of purchases, cash advances and of balance transfers from the previous day are increased by any purchases, cash advances or balance transfers posted to the Account that day and decreased by any payments or credits posted to the Account that day. Such daily principal balances are separately totaled and then divided by the number of days in the statement period (billing cycle), resulting in the “Average Daily Principal Balances” of purchases, cash advances and balance transfers shown on your statement."
311,17,"You can avoid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases by paying the total New Balance each month on or before the payment due date shown on your monthly statement. Otherwise, the New Balance of Purchases, and subsequent purchases from the date they are posted to your account, will be subject to FINANCE CHARGE, except that if during the previous billing cycle you paid all amounts owing in full by the Payment Due Date, then in the current billing cycle you will have a free interest period on the amount of the New Balance of Purchases remaining from the previous billing cycle that is paid by the Payment Due Date based on our payment allocation method. Cash Advances and Balance Transfers bear FINANCE CHARGES from the transaction date until paid. There is no FREE INTEREST period for Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. However, you can always keep the FINANCE CHARGE to a minimum by making payments, whatever the amount, as promptly and as often as possible."
311,18,"14. PERIODIC STATEMENTS. We will send you a statement every month showing your previous balance, purchases, cash advances and balance transfers, payments made on your account, periodic rate, annual percentage rate, finance charge and its method of computation, any other charges, free interest period, payment due date, procedures for error resolution, Minimum Payment required, and the closing date with corresponding New Balance for the billing cycle. You may not receive a statement on your Account if there has been no activity, if collections procedures have been initiated against you because you are in default, or we are legally prohibited from sending them. Each statement is deemed to be a correct statement unless you establish a billing error pursuant to the Federal Truth in Lending Act as described in this Agreement"
311,19,"15. DEFAULT. You will be in default and we may, to the extent permitted by law, terminate your credit line and declare the entire unpaid balance of the account immediately due and payable, under any of the following conditions: • You fail to make the minimum payment by the statement payment due date; • You breach any other promises made in or conditions of the Agreement and/or any other agreement with us; • You use your card for an illegal transaction; • If you become involved in any insolvency, receivership, guardianship, conservatorship, or any other proceeding which determines you are incapable of managing your financial affairs, including filing for Bankruptcy; • You have made a false or misleading statement in your credit application and/or in your representation to us while you owe money on your account; • A judgment or tax lien is filed against you or any attachment or garnishment is issued against any of your property or accounts, including anyone starting an action or proposing to seize any of your funds on deposit with us; • We in good faith determine that your creditworthiness (which includes your ability to repay us) has become unsatisfactory due to change in employment, increase in your other obligations, or because of any other reason, time being of the very essence; • You die; or • Government action precludes us from imposing the annual percentage rate or a government authority has notified us that continued advances constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. In the event of any default, we may, at our option, declare the entire balance on the Account to be immediately due and payable."

Sales, cash advance, credit or other slips cannot be returned with each statement. You must retain the copy of such slips furnished at the time of each transaction in order to verify the transactions listed on your statement. You agree to pay a reasonable fee for copies of transaction slips that you request."
311,29,"25. CREDITS. If merchants who honor your Card give you a credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by processing a credit which we will post to your Account. You should keep your copy of the credit slip to verify your monthly statement. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us on the Account we will credit such excess to the Account and, if the amount is $1.00 or more, we will credit it to your share account after two (2) months or upon your written request."
311,30,"26. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS. Purchases and cash advances made in foreign countries and foreign currencies will be billed to you in U.S. dollars.

311,31,"27.

We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: ● We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. ● The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. ● While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. ● We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: ● If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. ● If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.

If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct."

312,10,"3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account.

Note: A convenience check is not a check as that term is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code. It is an advance from Your credit card Account with Us and Your stop payment rights are provided under this Agreement with Us."
312,11,"4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
312,12,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on new purchases on the first day of the following billing cycle. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
312,13,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type (excluding new purchases), and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
312,14,"6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement"
312,15,"7. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars.

purchase. 
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 
1. The purchase must have been made in Your home state or within 100 miles of Your current mailing address, and the 
purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if Your purchase was based on 
an advertisement We mailed to You, or if We own the company that sold You the goods or services.) 
2. You must have used Your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a 
check that accesses Your credit card Account do not qualify. 
3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. 
If all of the criteria above are met and You are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact Us in writing or electronically at 
the address listed on Your statement. 
While We investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After We finish Our investigation, 
We will tell You Our decision. At that point, if We think You owe an amount and You do not pay, We may report You as

313,2,"This Consumer Credit Card Agreement and Disclosure together with the Account Opening Disclosure and any other Account opening documents or any subsequent documents provided to You related to this Account (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Agreement”) govern the terms and conditions of this Account. “We,” “Us,” “Our” and “Ours” and “Credit Union” refers to Community Resource Credit Union with which this Agreement is made. “You,” “Your,” and “Yours” refers to each applicant and co-applicant for the Account; any person responsible for paying the Account; and anyone You authorize to use, access or service the Account. ""Card"" means the Mastercard® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, including convenience checks, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
313,3,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
313,4,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."

If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
313,6,"3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — Mastercard World MemberSelect Rewards, Mastercard Platinum MyPath Premier - We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account.

You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give Us a reasonable opportunity to act on Your request. In addition, Your request must accurately describe the check including the exact Account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, You may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless You confirm Your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed.

You agree to indemnify and hold Us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to Our honoring Your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to Us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. Note: A convenience check is not a check as that term is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code. It is an advance from Your credit card Account with Us and Your stop payment rights are provided under this Agreement with Us"
313,8,"4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance."
313,9,"You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us"
313,10,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on new purchases on the first day of the following billing cycle. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of Your Account, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
313,11,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type (excluding new purchases), and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
313,12,"6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
313,14,"Mastercard World MemberSelect Rewards, Mastercard Platinum MyPath Premier - If You make a purchase or obtain a cash advance in a foreign currency, the transaction will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. Mastercard will convert the transaction into U.S. dollars depending on whether You complete the transaction with a Mastercard or if the transaction is processed by a network operated or affiliated with Mastercard. For transactions processed through Mastercard, the exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is either a governmentmandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate and is selected by Mastercard. The rate Mastercard uses for a particular transaction is the rate Mastercard selects for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is processed. The exchange rate used to convert the transaction may differ from the rate Mastercard receives and may differ from the rate applicable on the date the transaction occurred or was posted to Your Account."
313,15,"Mastercard Platinum Secured - A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to Your Account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that You complete or a merchant completes on Your Card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement You have with Us.

We may increase or decrease the APR effective on the first billing date after the cycle. If the APR increases, you will pay a higher Interest Charge and may pay a higher minimum payment."
314,27,"Interest Charge Calculation: New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a interest charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise an interest charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional interest charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. An interest charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later."
314,28,"The interest charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the interest charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To get the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. Then, we add all the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. For cash advances, the interest charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To get the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. Then, we add all the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances unless otherwise noted."
314,29,"Termination of Introductory or Promotional Rates: If during an Introductory or Promotional Rate period, we have not received the required minimum monthly payment within 60 days of the respective payment due date, we will increase the applicable APR to the standard non-promotional APR.

Nothing contained herein shall limit our right to foreclose against or sell any collateral, whether real or personal, to exercise any right of setoff, or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, during or after arbitration, including, but not limited to, our right to bring a legal proceeding against you in state or federal court to collect a debt owed by you.

If requested by any party, the arbitrator shall write an opinion containing the reasons for the award. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding except for any appeal rights under the FAA and except that if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, any party may appeal the award within 30 days to a three-arbitrator panel which shall review the award de novo. Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the cost of the appeal, regardless of its outcome.

Judgment upon any award by the arbitrator may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction."

We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
317,12,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."

The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
317,15,"A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed outside of the United States, where the cardholder’s country code differs from the merchant’s country code. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions Page 3 of 6 01214565-MXC30-C-1-040120 (MXC303-E) completed in a foreign currency.

331,26,"PAYING INTEREST ON PURCHASES.

Under this method, the Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the “average daily balance” of Cash Advances.

This agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.S. § 1 et seq. and the substantive law of the State of South Dakota (without applying its choice-of-law rules)."
331,55,"Arbitration Defined. “Arbitration” is a means of having an independent third party resolve a Dispute. A “Dispute” is any claim or controversy of any kind between you and us. The term Dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes, without limitation, all claims or demands (whether past, present, or future, including events that occurred prior to the opening of this Card Account and whether or not a credit card is issued), based on any legal or equitable theory (contract, tort, alleged regulatory violation, or otherwise) and regardless of the type of relief sought (i.e., money, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief). A Dispute includes, by way of example and without limitation, any claim based upon a federal or state constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation, or common law, and any issue concerning the validity, enforceability, or scope of this arbitration agreement. For purposes of this arbitration provision, the terms “you” and “your” include any co-signer, co-obligor, guarantor, or authorized user and also your heirs, guardian, personal representative, or trustee in bankruptcy. The terms “we,” “our,” and “us” include our employees, officers, directors, members, managers, attorneys, affiliated companies, predecessors, and assigns, as well as our marketing, servicing, and collection representatives and agents."
331,56,"Choice of Arbitrator. The party filing an arbitration must choose either of the following arbitration firms for initiating and pursuing an arbitration: the American Arbitration Association or JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.). If you claim you have a Dispute with us, but you do not initiate an arbitration or select an arbitrator, we may do so. You may obtain copies of the current rules of each of the arbitration firms and forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by contacting them as follows: American Arbitration Association 335 Madison Avenue, Floor 10 New York, NY 10017-4605 Website: www.adr.org JAMS 1920 Main Street, Suite 300 Irvine, CA 92614"
331,57,"The policies and procedures of the selected arbitration firm will apply provided that these are consistent with this arbitration agreement. To the extent the arbitration firm’s rules or procedures are different than the terms of this arbitration agreement, the terms of this agreement will apply"
331,58,"If neither arbitration firm listed in this agreement is available to resolve the Dispute, you and we may each select a local arbitrator. The local arbitrators selected by you and us shall then agree upon the selection of another arbitrator who will hear and resolve the Dispute. The arbitrator selected to resolve the Dispute must be an attorney with at least 10 years experience, retired judge, or arbitrator registered and in good standing with an arbitration association and arbitrate pursuant to such arbitrator’s rules applicable to consumer disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party or local arbitrator may select an arbitrator who refuses to enforce an arbitration agreement containing a class-action waiver, because you and we have in this arbitration agreement waived any right to arbitrate a dispute on a class-action, representative-action, or consolidated basis."
331,59,"What Arbitration Costs. If you initiate the arbitration, you will be responsible for the first $50 of filing fees and other costs or fees, and we will pay the balance of the filing fee and any costs or fees charged by the arbitrator above the first $50. If you cannot afford to pay the first $50, we may pay this in our discretion. If we initiate the arbitration, we will pay the filing fee and any costs or fees charged by the arbitrator. Unless prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award fees, costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the party who substantially prevails in the arbitration"

332,4,"Average Daily Balance (including new transactions). The Interest Charge on Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Advances is calculated using the Average Daily Balance Method (including new transactions). Under this method, the Interest Charge for a billing cycle is computed by applying the monthly periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances, as applicable. To calculate the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances each day, add any new Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances, and subtract any payments, credits, non-accruing fees, and unpaid Interest Charges applicable to Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances as of their posting dates. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle"
332,5,Periodic Rate. The monthly periodic rate is calculated by dividing the Annual Percentage Rate by 12.
332,6,"Variable Rate Disclosures. The Prime Rate used to determine your variable Annual Percentage Rate for Credit Purchases, Cash Advances, and Balance Transfers for the billing period ending in any month is the U.S. Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the 1st day (or if the 1st day is not a business day, the preceding business day) of the prior month. If more than one U.S. Prime Rate is published, the highest rate will be used. The variable Annual Percentage Rate for Credit Purchases, Cash Advances, and Balance Transfers will increase if the Prime Rate increases. An increase in the variable Annual Percentage Rate will result in an increase in your monthly periodic rate and may result in an increase in your Minimum Payment Due."

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
401,22,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
401,23,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions"
401,24,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
401,25,3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees
401,26,"For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full."
401,27,"If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
401,28,"Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
401,29,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
401,30,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
401,31,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
401,32,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
401,33,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card.

If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
401,36,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."

""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
402,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
402,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
402,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
402,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
402,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
402,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
402,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
402,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
402,27,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
402,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges"
402,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."
402,30,"11. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at PO Box 10409, Des Moines, IA, 50306-0409 or call Us at (800) 234-5354, seven days a week 24 hours a day.

Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
403,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
403,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
403,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
403,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account.

If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card.

Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
403,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason.

403,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment.

When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."

404,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower.

If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
404,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
404,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
404,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
404,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars.

405,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."

If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
405,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
405,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
405,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
405,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
405,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day.

If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
405,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment.

406,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement"
406,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
406,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
406,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
406,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
406,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
406,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
406,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card.

406,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
406,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
407,18,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
407,19,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
407,20,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
407,21,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
407,22,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
407,23,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
407,24,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
407,25,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
407,26,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
407,27,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
407,28,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."
407,29,"11.

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
408,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
408,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
408,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
408,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
408,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
408,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
408,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
408,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
408,27,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
408,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
408,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."

""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
409,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
409,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
409,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
409,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
409,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type"
409,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
409,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
409,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card.

409,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
409,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe"

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
410,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
410,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
410,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
410,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
410,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
410,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
410,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
410,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card.

410,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
410,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."
410,30,"11.

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
411,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
411,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
411,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
411,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
411,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
411,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
411,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
411,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

411,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
411,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
412,19,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
412,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
412,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
412,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
412,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type"
412,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
412,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
412,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
412,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
412,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."
412,30,"11.

You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
413,20,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
413,21,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law"
413,22,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 3.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 5 01401789-MXC30-P-1-111417 (MXC303-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
413,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
413,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
413,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
413,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
413,27,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
413,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
413,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."
413,30,"11. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at PO Box 10409, Des Moines, IA, 50306-0409 or call Us at (800) 234-5354, seven days a week 24 hours a day.

You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account.

You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act.

If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
414,23,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
414,24,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
414,25,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
414,26,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
414,27,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
414,28,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
414,29,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default if You are more than ten (10) days late in making any minimum payment or other required payment. You will also be in default if You do not comply with the terms of this Agreement and Your failure to comply materially impairs any property You gave as security for this Agreement or Your ability to repay what You owe under this Agreement. When You are in default and after expiration of any right You have to cure Your default under the applicable state law, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of Your full Account balance. If immediate payment is demanded, You agree to continue paying finance charges at the periodic rate charged before default, until what You owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for Your Account may be applied towards what You owe."

If any provision of this agreement is determined to be unlawful, the rest of the agreement will stand and the unlawful provision will be deemed amended to conform to applicable law. All Cards are our property and must be returned to us immediately according to our instructions, and we may repossess a Card at any time in our sole discretion."
419,3,"1. Promise to pay—You agree to pay us the total amount of purchases, cash advances, finance charges or other fees or charges which arise from use of a Card by you or any other person, unless the other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use and you receive no personal benefit from the use. You agree to be jointly and severally liable with anyone else who has made the same promise."
419,4,"2. Credit limit—Your credit limit is stated on the credit card carrier, as well as on your monthly statement. You promise to make purchases and cash advances only up to your credit limit. Your promise to pay continues to apply even if the amount due exceeds your credit limit. Obtaining credit in excess of your credit limit does not increase your credit limit. We can change your credit limit at any time to any amount (including zero). We will state the new credit limit on your next monthly statement"
419,5,"3. Purchases and cash advances—You may use your Card, up to your credit limit, to buy or lease goods, services or insurance wherever the Card is honored. You may also use your Card to get a cash advance from participating financial institutions. However, you agree not to use your Card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state or local law, and you understand that any such use will constitute an event of default under this agreement. We are not responsible for the refusal of anyone to honor your Card."
419,6,"4. Monthly statements—We will send you a statement at the end of each billing cycle in which the Account has a balance. Each monthly statement will show purchases, cash advances, payments, adjustments, fees, debits and credits made to the Account during the billing cycle. Each monthly statement will also show the new balance, the finance charge for the billing cycle, the minimum amount you must pay, and the deadline for our receipt of your payment, which will be 25 days after the last day covered by the statement"

Our acceptance of checks or money orders labeled ""payment in full"" or words to that effect, will not constitute an accord and satisfaction nor a waiver of any rights we have to receive full payment."
419,8,"6. Periodic finance charge—The periodic finance charge rate is stated as an annual percentage rate and as a monthly periodic rate on the Approval Letter and on your monthly statement. The periodic finance charge for each billing cycle will be computed by multiplying the periodic finance charge rate times the average daily balance of your Account during that cycle. We get the ""average daily balance"" by adding together the daily balance for each day in a cycle and dividing the total by the number of days in that cycle. The minimum finance charge for a statement period during which there is a finance charge is stated on the Approval Letter. We get the ""daily balance"" of the Account by using one of the following methods:"
419,9,"A. Payment within the grace period method—If the Approval Letter specifies a grace period in the paragraph labeled ""Annual Percentage Rate,"" and the new balance shown on a monthly statement is paid in full by the payment due date shown on the statement, then no finance charge will be imposed on the purchases itemized on that statement. If this is the case, then we get the ""daily balance"" of the Account for each day by adding to the beginning balance all cash advances and other debits (other than purchases) and deducting all payments and other credits made or received as of that day."
419,10,"B. No grace method—If the Approval Letter does not specify a grace period in the paragraph labeled ""Annual Percentage Rate"" or there is a grace period but the new balance shown on a monthly statement is not paid in full by the payment due date, then the ""daily balance"" of the Account for each day is determined by adding to the beginning balance all purchases, cash advances and other debits and deducting all payments and other credits made or received as of that day."
419,11,"7. Cash advance fee—Cash advances are subject to the cash advance fee stated on the Approval Letter, which is also a finance charge. The cash advance fee is in addition to the periodic finance charge, which is also imposed on a cash advance from the date of the cash advance. The following transactions will be treated as cash advances: • using your Card to obtain cash from a participating Automated Teller Machine (""ATM""); • using your Card to obtain cash from a participating financial institution; • using a convenience check drawn on the Account; • obtaining money orders, travelers checks, foreign currency, lottery tickets, casino chips, vouchers redeemable for cash or similar items"

You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us orally by calling 1- 800-234-5354 or you notify us in writing by mailing the notice to P.O. Box 10409, Des Moines, IA 50306. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50."
419,14,"10. Default—You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You also will be in default if you violate any other provision of this agreement and such violation materially impairs the prospect of you paying the amount due on the Account. Upon default, we may demand immediate payment of the entire amount due on the Account and we may enforce our right to this payment as permitted by law."
419,15,"11. International transactions— When you use your Card for a transaction denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the transaction amount will be converted into U.S. dollars by applying an exchange rate selected by the Card Association from among the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets or the government-mandated rate on the date the transaction is processed. The rate chosen may vary from the rate the Card Association itself receives. When you use your Card in a transaction outside of the United States to make a purchase, obtain a cash advance, obtain a credit voucher, or reverse any of these transactions, a FINANCE CHARGE equal to one percent of the amount of the transaction (expressed as a positive number) will be assessed against your Account. ""Card Association"" means either VISA International or MasterCard International."

419,22,"You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your statement that are not in question. If we find that we made a mistake on your statement, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn't make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due."

And, we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.

You agree that your credit limit is the maximum amount (purchases, cash advances, finance charges, plus ""other charges"") which you will have outstanding on your account at any time. Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled “Statements and Notices”) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union’s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance.

In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, you may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless you confirm your request in writing within that time.

If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request."

You agree that you will not use your card for any transaction that is illegal under applicable federal, state, or local law. Even if you use your card for an illegal transaction, you will be responsible for all amounts and charges incurred in connection with the transaction. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, you may also use your card to purchase instruments and engage in transactions that we consider the equivalent of cash. Such transactions will be posted to your account as cash advances and include, but are not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, and casino gaming chips, as applicable. This paragraph shall not be interpreted as permitting or authorizing any transaction that is illegal."
423,5,"3. PROMISE TO PAY — You promise to pay all charges (purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, use of convenience checks or any other charge) made to your account by you or anyone you authorize to use your account. You also promise to pay all finance charges and other charges added to your account under the terms of this Agreement or another agreement you made with the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS also applies to your account."
423,6,"4. PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement."
423,7,"5. FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date)."
423,8,"The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases."
423,9,"For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances."
423,10,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
423,11,"A fee (finance charge), calculated in U.S. dollars, will be imposed on all foreign transactions, including purchases, cash advances and credits to your account. A foreign transaction is any transaction that you complete or a merchant completes on your card outside of the United States, with the exception of U.S. military bases, U.S. territories, U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
423,12,"7. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account. If applicable to your account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. Your account may also be subject to additional fees as set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. a. Balance Transfer Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Balance Transfer Fee (finance charge), the fee as disclosed on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement will be charged to your account when you transfer a balance from an account of another creditor to the account subject to this Agreement. b. Foreign Transaction Fee (Finance Charge). If your account is subject to a Foreign Transaction Fee (finance charge), a fee may be charged to your account for transactions made outside of the United States or in a foreign currency. c. Late Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Late Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when you do not make the required minimum payment by or within the number of days of the statement Payment Due Date set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. d. Over-the-Credit Limit Fee. If you have elected the feature to allow your account to go over your credit limit, we may charge you a fee as allowed by law. However, in no case will we impose an over-the-limit fee except in the next two billing DILEX3 (MXC503 CCM004)-e cycles unless you have obtained an additional extension of credit in excess of such credit limit during each subsequent cycle or you have reduced the balance below the credit limit as of the end of each bill cycle. e. Returned Payment Fee. If your account is subject to a Returned Payment Fee, the fee will be charged to your account when a payment is returned for any reason. f. Document Copy Fee. If your account is subject to a Document Copy Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each copy of a sales draft or statement that you request (except when the request is made in connection with a billing error made by the Credit Union). g. Rush Fee. If your account is subject to a Rush Fee, except as limited by applicable law, a fee may be charged to your account for each rush card that you request, providing delivery of the card is also available by standard mail service, without paying a fee for delivery. h. Emergency Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to an Emergency Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged to your account for each emergency replacement card that is issued to you. i. Card Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a Card Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged for each replacement card that is issued to you for any reason. j. Pay-by-Phone Fee.

423,13,"8. PAYMENTS — Each month you must pay at least the minimum payment shown on your statement by the date specified on the statement. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the minimum payment or pay the total new balance in full. If you make extra or larger payments, you are still required to make at least the minimum payment each month your account has a balance (other than a credit balance). For our Visa Platinum Preferred (Variable) card, the minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $30.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement. For our Visa Platinum Preferred card, the minimum payment is 3.00% of your total new balance, or $30.00, whichever is greater, plus the amount of any prior minimum payments that you have not made, all outstanding unpaid fees and charges, and any amount you are over your credit limit by the date specified on the statement.

The Credit Union also has the right to demand immediate payment of any amount by which you are over your credit limit. In accordance with applicable law, the Credit Union may not post payments to your account or reflect them in your available credit limit on the date they are received. The Credit Union may delay replenishing your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared."
423,14,"9. PAYMENT ALLOCATION — Subject to applicable law, your payments may be applied to what you owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses. However, in every case, in the event you make a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable annual percentage rate."
423,15,"10. SECURITY INTEREST — You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods you purchase. If you give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, your pledged shares will secure your account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure your account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount."
423,16,"Your Account is secured by all other shares you have in any individual or joint account with the Credit Union, except for shares in an Individual Retirement Account or in any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security. These other shares may be withdrawn unless you are in default under this agreement. You authorize the Credit Union to apply the balance in your individual or joint share accounts to pay any amounts due on your Account if you should default. Collateral securing other loans you have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other agreement."
423,17,"11. DEFAULT — You will be in default if you fail to make any minimum payment or other required payment by the date that it is due. You will be in default if you break any promise you make under this Agreement. You will be in default if you die, file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, that is, unable to pay your obligations when they become due. You will be in default if you make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update. You will also be in default if something happens that the Credit Union believes may substantially reduce your ability to repay what you owe."
423,18,"When you are in default, the Credit Union has the right to demand immediate payment of your full account balance without giving you notice. If immediate payment is demanded, you agree to continue paying finance charges at the DILEX3 (MXC503 CCM004)-e periodic rate charged before default, until what you owe has been paid, and any shares that were given as security for your account may be applied towards what you owe."
423,19,"12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, at PO Box 2937, Aurora IL 60507 or telephone 800-325-3678 seven days a week, 24 hours a day, of the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your credit card. You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card. You will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use. You will have no liability for unauthorized transactions made with your credit card, unless you are grossly negligent in the handling of your card. In any case, your liability will not exceed $50.00."
423,20,"13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT — As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. If permitted by law and specified in the notice to you, the change will apply to your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Either you or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by you or the Credit Union will not affect your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this Agreement. Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges you owe under this agreement are subject to all applicable laws and regulations regarding repayment requirements. You are also responsible for all transactions made to your account after termination, unless the transactions were unauthorized. The card or cards you receive remain the property of the Credit Union and you must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by you or the Credit Union. If this is a joint account, the paragraph on JOINT ACCOUNTS of this Agreement also applies to termination of the account."

423,22,"15. CREDIT REVIEW AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION — You authorize the Credit Union to investigate your credit standing when opening or reviewing your account. You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding your account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about your credit standing.

423,23,"16. RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS — Merchants and others who honor your card may give credit for returns or adjustments, and they will do so by sending the Credit Union a credit slip which will be posted to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe the Credit Union, the amount will be applied against future purchases and cash advances. If the credit balance amount is $1.00 or more, it will be refunded upon your written request or automatically after six months."
423,24,"17. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS/CARD ENHANCEMENTS — The Credit Union may from time to time offer additional services to your account, such as travel accident insurance, at no additional cost to you. You understand that the Credit Union is not obligated to offer such services and may withdraw or change them at any time."

The Credit Union is subject to claims and defenses (other than tort claims) arising out of goods or services you purchase with the card if you have made a good faith attempt but have been unable to obtain satisfaction from the merchant or service provider, and (a) your purchase was made in response to an advertisement the Credit Union sent or participated in sending to you; or (b) your purchase cost more than $50.00 and was made in your state or within 100 miles of your home."
423,26,"19. JOINT ACCOUNTS — If this is a joint account, each of you will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement. This means that the Credit Union can require any one of you individually to repay the entire amount owed under this Agreement.

423,27,"20. EFFECT OF AGREEMENT — This Agreement is the contract which applies to all transactions on your account even though the sales, cash advances, credit or other slips you sign or receive may contain different terms."

424,4,How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called “average daily balance (including new purchases).” Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided below in Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law.
424,5,"Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law FINANCE CHARGES: In order to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases made since your last statement date, you must pay the ""Total New Balance"" shown on your most recent monthly statement on or before the ""Payment Due Date"" shown on that statement (which will not be less than 25 days from the ""Statement Date""). Otherwise the finance charge on purchases is calculated on the next statement period on previously billed but unpaid purchases and on new purchases from the date they are posted to your account. Balance transfers and cash advances are always subject to a finance charge from the date they are posted to your account. You can always keep the FINANCE CHARGES to a minimum by making payments, whatever the amount, as promptly and as often as possible. Your periodic rate (for purchase, cash advance and balance transfers) is 0.826%, which corresponds to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 9.9%. The FINANCE CHARGES are calculated by applying the above periodic (monthly) rate to the “average daily principal balance” (including new purchases) of your account. An average daily pri ncipal balance is calculated separately for purchase and balance transfer/cash advance transactions, and is determined as follows: For each day during the statement period (billing cycle) the principal balances of purchases and of balance transfers/cash advances from the previous day are increased by any purchases or balance transfers/cash advances posted to the Account that day and decreased by any payments or credits posted to the Account that day. This gives us the daily balance. Such daily principal balances are separately totaled and then divided by the total number of days in the billing cycle resulting in the “average daily principal balances” of purchases and cash advances (which includes balance transfers) shown on your statement."

This Agreement is a Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement as well as a contract."
424,16,"1. Responsibility — By signing the Application that corresponds to and is incorporated into this Agreement, you applied to us for a Platinum Visa Credit Card Line of Credit Loan. If we approve the loan and issue you a Card, you promise to repay all debts and the finance charges thereon arising from any authorized use of the Card. You agree not to let anyone else use the Card, other than the person(s) that you have designated in writing to us as an “authorized user.” You are agreeing with us that you authorize any and all uses such authorized user makes of the Card, whether or not such use was within the authority (actual, apparent or implied) that you gave that person in connection with the Card or otherwise. Therefore, you will be liable for all such use of the Card. Of course, once you notify us, we will take prompt steps to try to prevent any further Card use by that person. If this Agreement is signed by two persons, the Account is joint; that is, each of you, separately and jointly with each other, is liable for all debts on the Account and FINANCE CHARGES thereon. Your obligation to pay all such debts and FINANCE CHARGES thereon continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct that only one of you, or some person other than you (or both of you), must pay such debts and FINANCE CHARGES."
424,17,"2. Credit Line — We have established a self-replenishing line of credit for you and will notify you of the amount thereof (“credit limit”) in the mailer in which we send your Card. That mailer is hereby incorporated herein as part of this Agreement. You agree not to let your Account Balance exceed such amount. Each payment you make on the Account will replenish your credit limit by the part of that payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in the credit limit by a written application, which must be approved by us. We may increase or decrease the limit from time to time or may, with good cause, revoke your Card and terminate this Agreement; in either event, we will give you written notice of such action. “Good Cause” includes your failure to satisfy the terms of this Agreement or our adverse reevaluation of your credit worthiness. You may terminate this Agreement, at any time and for any reason, by giving us written notice. Nevertheless, termination by you or by us does not affect your obligation to pay all debts and FINANCE CHARGES thereon arising from authorized use of your Card. The Cards remain our property and you must recover and surrender to us all Cards upon our request or upon termination of this Agreement."
424,18,"3. Using the Card — Immediately upon receipt of your card(s), each must be signed (in the space provided on the back) by the person whose name is embossed thereon. That signature must be in the same form as embossed on the front of the Card. To make a purchase or Cash Advance, present the Card to a participating Visa plan merchant or financial institution, or to us, and sign the sales draft or cash advance draft which will be imprinted with your Card. Please note that we are not responsible if a particular Visa plan merchant or financial institution refuses to honor your Card. You will receive a copy of any draft you sign when using the Card which you should retain to verify your monthly statement. We will upon request furnish you with a copy of a draft at a charge of $5.00 per copy; however, no charge will be made in cases covered by Sec. 226.13 (f) (2) of the regulation (i.e., Regulation Z) issued under the Truth-in-Lending Act. You agree not to make or permit to be made any illegal transactions on your Account through use of a Card, a check, or in any other manner. We may deny authorization for any Internet gambling transaction"
424,19,"4. Monthly Payment — We will mail you a statement every month showing your Previous Balance of purchases and cash advances, the current transactions on your Account, the remaining credit available under your Credit Line, the New Balance of purchases and cash advances, the Total New Balance, the FINANCE CHARGES due to date, and the Minimum Payment required. Every month you must pay the Minimum Payment within 25 days of your statement closing date. You may; of course, pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment, or pay the Total New Balance in full; and you will reduce your FINANCE CHARGES by doing so. The Minimum Payment will be either (a) 1.5% of your Total New Balance, or $10.00, whichever is greater; or (b) your Total New Balance, if it is less than $10.00 plus (c) any portion of the Minimum Payment(s) shown on prior statement(s) which remains unpaid. In addition, at any time your Total New Balance exceeds your Credit Line, you must immediately pay the excess upon our demand. We will apply your payments first to previously billed and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES on purchases; then to previously billed and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES on cash advances; then to previously billed purchases; then to cash advances; and then to new purchases, whether or not billed on the monthly statement. However, any payment equal to, or greater than, the Previous Balance of Purchases will be applied first to that balance and any FINANCE CHARGES thereon so as to avoid continuing accrual of FINANCE CHARGES on that amount"
424,20,"5. Finance Charges – The way we calculate FINANCE CHARGES, including your periodic rate and corresponding ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE, are disclosed above in the Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law. The FINANCE CHARGES hereunder may be increased pursuant to paragraph 9 on the reverse side, if you engage in foreign transactions."
424,21,"6. Other Charges — If the required minimum payment due under this Agreement is not paid within 10 days after the payment due date, you agree to pay the Credit Union a LATE CHARGE of $25, unless the minimum monthly payment amount is less than $25, in which case the late charge will be equal to the minimum monthly payment. Your Account may be subject to other charges, which you agree to pay, including a fee of $5 for the replacement of card(s), a $2 fee per copy of statements, $5 for a Personal Identification Number (PIN) replacement, and a $5 fee for a copy of a sales draft (see Section 3 for an exception to that fee). You also agree to pay a charge in the amount of $25 for any check made payable to your Account and returned due to non-sufficient funds."
424,22,"7. Credits — If merchants who honor your Card give you a credit for returns or adjustments, they will do so by posting a credit to your Account. You should keep your copy of the credit slip to verify your monthly statement. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us on the Account, we will credit such excess to your savings account or we will refund it upon request."
424,23,"8. Waiver of Security — Regardless of anything contained in any other loan document you have previously signed, we hereby expressly waive any security interest, or pledge of shares or deposits, as security for balances owing on this Account."
424,24,9. Foreign Transactions — Purchases and Cash Advances you make in foreign countries and foreign currency will be billed to you in U.S. dollars.

In any case, your liability will not exceed $50."
424,27,"12. Default — The Minimum Payment shown on the statement is due by the payment due date as shown on the statement. You will be in default if you fail to make the minimum payment by the statement payment due date. You will also be in default if (a) you breach any other conditions of the Agreement, (b) if we determine that your creditworthiness (which includes your ability to repay us) has become unsatisfactory due to change in employment, increase in your other obligations, or any other reason, (c) if your Account balance exceeds your credit limit, or (d) in the event of your death. In the event of any default or in the event this Agreement is terminated by you or by us for any reason, the entire balance on the Account becomes due and payable forthwith. You also agree that, in case of default, you will pay all usual and customary costs of collection permitted by law, including, but not limited to, attorney fees and expenses incurred by us in the enforcement of this Agreement."
424,28,"13. Credit Information — You authorize us to investigate your credit standing when opening, renewing or reviewing your Account, and you authorize us to disclose information regarding our experience with you under this Agreement to credit bureaus and other creditors."

The notice will be sent to your last known address appearing in our records when it is sent, and will state the date upon which the amendment will become effective. Except where prohibited by law, all such changes will apply to new transactions and to amounts you already owe, unless you provide notice of your election to terminate the account and surrender your card(s) on or before the effective date of the changes, in which case you will be entitled to repay your balance in accordance with the terms and conditions in effect at that time"
424,31,"16. Cash Advance by Machine — We will furnish you with a Personal Identification Number (PIN). If Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) or other electronic devices are available while this Agreement remains in effect which make it possible for you to obtain a Cash Advance by use of your Card in such a machine, your use of that number, together with your Card, in getting a Cash Advance from such a machine is agreed to constitute your signature for purposes of such Cash Advance."
424,32,"17. Personal Identification Number (PIN) – Upon request, we will furnish you with a Personal Identification Number (PIN). You agree to keep your PIN confidential. You also agree you won’t write the PIN o n the Card or anything you keep with the Card.

425,4,How We Will Calculate Your Balance: We use a method called “average daily balance (including new purchases).” Billing Rights: Information on your rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights is provided below in Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law.
425,5,"Additional Disclosures Required by Federal Law FINANCE CHARGES: In order to avoid a FINANCE CHARGE on purchases made since your last statement date, you must pay the ""Total New Balance"" shown on your most recent monthly statement on or before the ""Payment Due Date"" shown on that statement (which will not be less than 25 days from the ""Statement Date""). Otherwise the finance charge on purchases is calculated on the next statement period on previously billed but unpaid purchases and on new purchases from the date they are posted to your account. Balance transfers and cash advances are always subject to a finance charge from the date they are posted to your account. You can always keep the FINANCE CHARGES to a minimum by making payments, whatever the amount, as promptly and as often as possible. Your periodic rate (for purchase, cash advance and balance transfers) is 1.08%, which corresponds to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 12.96%. The FINANCE CHARGES are calculated by applying the above periodic (monthly) rate to the “average daily principal balance” (including new purchases) of your account. An average daily principal balance is calculated separately for purchase and balance transfer/cash advance transactions, and is determined as follows: For each day during the statement period (billing cycle) the principal balances of purchases and of balance transfers/cash advances from the previous day are increased by any purchases or balance transfers/cash advances posted to the Account that day and decreased by any payments or credits posted to the Account that day. This gives us the daily balance. Such daily principal balances are separately totaled and then divided by the total number of days in the billing cycle resulting in the “average daily principal balances ” of purchases and cash advances (which includes balance transfers) shown on your statement."
425,6,"YOUR BILLING RIGHTS: Keep this Document for Future Use This notice informs you about your rights and responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at: Educational Community Credit Union ATTN: CREDIT CARD DEPARTMENT, 1551 South 9th Street, Kalamazoo, MI 49009. In your letter, give us your name and account number, the dollar amount of the suspected error, and what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake."
425,7,"You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement and at least three business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. If you call us, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may be required to pay the amount in question."
425,8,"What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days after receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit."
425,9,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50.00 of the amount in question, even if your bill is correct."
425,10,"Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: Educational Community Credit Union, ATTN: CREDIT CARD DEPARTMENT, 1551 South 9th Street, Kalamazoo, MI 49009. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent."
425,11,"Classic VISA Card Agreement In this Classic VISA Card Agreement (called the “Agreement”), the words “you” and “your” mean or refer to each and all persons who have applied for the Card or Cards by signing this Agreement. “Card” means the Classic Credit Card or Cards and any duplicates and renewals thereof or substitutions thereof we may issue. “Account” means your Classic Visa Credit Card line of credit loan account with us. “We,” “us” and “ours” means or refers to this Credit Union. This Agreement is a Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement as well as a contract."
425,12,"1. Responsibility — By signing the Application that corresponds to and is incorporated into this Agreement, you applied to us for a Classic Visa Credit Card Line of Credit Loan. If we approve the loan and issue you a Card, you promise to repay all debts and the finance charges thereon arising from any authorized use of the Card. You agree not to let anyone else use the Card, other than the person(s) that you have designated in writing to us as an “authorized user.” You are agreeing with us that you authorize any and all uses such authorized user makes of the Card, whether or not such use was within the authority (actual, apparent or implied) that you gave that person in connection with the Card or otherwise. Therefore, you will be liable for all such use of the Card. Of course, once you notify us, we will take prompt steps to try to prevent any further Card use by that person. If this Agreement is signed by two persons, the Account is joint; that is, each of you, separately and jointly with each other, is liable for all debts on the Account and FINANCE CHARGES thereon. Your obligation to pay all such debts and FINANCE CHARGES thereon continues even though an agreement, divorce decree or other court judgment to which we are not a party may direct that only one of you, or some person other than you (or both of you), must pay such debts and FINANCE CHARGES."
425,13,"2. Credit Line — We have established a self-replenishing line of credit for you and will notify you of the amount thereof (“credit limit”) in the mailer in which we send your Card. That mailer is hereby incorporated herein as part of this Agreement. You agree not to let your Account Balance exceed such amount. Each payment you make on the Account will replenish your credit limit by the part of that payment which is applied to principal. You may request an increase in the credit limit by a written application, which must be approved by us. We may increase or decrease the limit from time to time or may, with good cause, revoke your Card and terminate this Agreement; in either event, we will give you written notice of such action. “G ood Cause” includes your failure to satisfy the terms of this Agreement or our adverse reevaluat ion of your credit worthiness. You may terminate this Agreement, at any time and for any reason, by giving us written notice.

For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 1.50% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. © CUNA Mutual Group 1991, 2006, 09, 10, 12, 14, 16 All Rights Reserved 00910721-MXC30-C-1-060721 (MXC305-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
426,11,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
426,12,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
426,13,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
426,14,"6. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars.

The exchange rate used on the transaction date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the processing date or cardholder statement posting date. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed outside of the United States, where the cardholder’s country code differs from the merchant’s country code. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed in a foreign currency. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
428,2,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower.

You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
428,5,"3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing.

428,6,"4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared.

If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
428,7,"5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
428,8,"6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
428,9,"7. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."
428,10,"8. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, Page 3 of 6 04802327-MXC30-P-1-062117 (MXC302-E) internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
428,11,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — If You default, if the Card is lost or stolen, or We change the Account for any reason, We may suspend automatic charges with third party vendors. If preauthorized charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the third party to reinstate the automatic charges."
428,12,"10. DEFAULT — Upon default, the entire outstanding balance due under this Agreement shall, unless excused by Our Board of Directors, become immediately due and payable, subject only to any right to cure default which You may have under Section 425.105 of the Wisconsin Statutes.

""Card"" means the Mastercard® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card. Finance charges include interest charges."
434,9,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
434,10,"1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
434,11,"2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law."
434,12,"3. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. Page 2 of 6 00904672-MXC30-C-1-052621 (MXC304-E) If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us."
434,13,"4. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — Purchases - We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle’s billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid paying additional finance charges, You must pay the entire new balance of purchases by the Payment Due Date on each cycle’s billing statement. Cash Advances and Balance Transfers - There is no grace period. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later. You will continue to accrue interest on cash advances and balance transfers through the date of payment. The interest accrued is not reflected in the cycle’s billing statement in which the cash advance or balance transfer is made, but it is reflected in the next cycle’s billing statement. If You would like to pay Your cash advance or balance transfer balance and any interest that has accrued on the cash advance or balance transfer, You may contact Us for a payoff amount. How We Calculate Your Average Daily Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type."
434,14,"5. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."
434,15,"6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is based on rates observed in the wholesale market or government-mandated rates, where applicable. The currency conversion rate Mastercard uses for a particular transaction is the rate for the applicable currency on the date the transaction occurs. However, in limited situations, particularly where transaction submissions to Mastercard for processing are delayed, the currency conversion rate Mastercard uses may be the rate for the applicable currency on the date the transaction is processed."
434,16,"7. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."
434,17,"8. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — If You have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring or as requested basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring or card-on-file charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring or card-on-file charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card. Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring or card-on-file charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring or card-on-file charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
434,18,"9. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges."
434,19,"10. DEFAULT — You will be in default under this Agreement if You fail to pay the Minimum Payment Due by its Payment Due Date; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored or that We must return because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit that is returned unpaid; make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; file for bankruptcy; or die. You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement You have with Us. If You default, We may close Your Account and require You to pay any unpaid balance immediately, subject to applicable law. We can demand immediate payment (acceleration) of the entire unpaid balance under this Agreement without giving You advance notice. Unless, otherwise prohibited by law, any judgment entered on the amount owed by You will accrue post-judgment interest at the rate of the lower of 18.00% per annum or the maximum rate of interest allowed by law beginning on the date of the judgment until the debt is paid. In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account. We may also exercise any other rights given by law when You are in default. Unless You are a Covered Borrower under the Military Lending Act, You waive any right You have to receive demand for payment, notice of intent to demand immediate payment (accelerate) and notice of demand for immediate payment (acceleration)."

In this Agreement, the words ""you,"" ""your,"" ""yours,"" ""applicant,"" and ""Borrower"" mean any person who signs the application for this Account, any joint obligor, guarantor, authorized user, or the person whose name is embossed on the Card. The words ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" and ""Credit Union"" mean ELGA Credit Union. The word ""Card"" means any one or more credit cards issued under this Account. If you sign an application for this Account or sign or use any Card or PIN, or allow others to use the Card or PIN, you and they will have accepted this Agreement just as if you and they signed it, and you and they, jointly and severally, will be bound by the following terms and conditions which will govern this Account."
449,3,"1. You Promise to Pay You promise to pay us all amounts, plus any Interest Charges, which arise from use of the Card or Account by you or any other person, and to be jointly and severally liable with such a person, unless such other person does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and you received no benefit from the use. You promise to pay us either by direct payment or by automatic transfers from shares or by payroll deduction."
449,4,"2. Account Access a. Purchases, Cash Advances, and Balance Transfers. You must sign the Card to use it. Once you have signed the Card, you can use it to buy or lease goods, services, or insurance wherever the Card is honored, up to the full amount of your Credit Line. You may use your Account to get cash advances from us. You may also use your Card to get a cash advance from participating financial institutions and to access your line of credit at automatic teller machines (“ATMs”) within the VISA network or any other ATMs."
449,5,"b. VISA Convenience Checks. If we approve, you may obtain advances under your Account by writing preprinted VISA convenience loan checks that we supply to you. Your use of loan checks will be shown either as a purchase, cash advance, or balance transfer on your monthly statement. We may not honor your loan check if: your check is postdated; payment of the check would exceed your Credit Line; a check is signed by person without authorized access; the amount of the check is less than the minimum required amount; your Account has been terminated or suspended, or any drafts have been reported lost or stolen. You may stop payment on a loan check if you provide us with the exact information describing the check. If you give us incorrect information, we will not be responsible for failing to stop payment. You understand there may be a charge for each stop payment order requested. Our liability for a wrongful dishonor is limited to your actual charges; however, a dishonor for the reasons stated above is not a wrongful dishonor. Only the person whose name is printed on a convenience check may sign it. All convenience checks must be written in U.S. dollars. We will not certify a convenience check. You may write these checks for any amount providing your total outstanding balance does not exceed your available Credit Line and your credit card remains in good standing. We are entitled to return it unpaid if there is not enough available credit on your Account to pay it, if you are in default under this Agreement, if your card or convenience checks have been reported lost or stolen, or if the convenience check is post-dated. A VISA convenience check may not be used to make a payment on your VISA credit card account or any"
449,6,other loan account you have with us. The Credit Union shall have no liability for any convenience check returned in excess of your Credit Line.
449,7,"3. Credit Line If we approve your application, this Agreement will constitute a revolving line of credit for an amount which will be the Credit Line under your Account. We will advise you of the amount of your Credit Line. That amount will be the maximum amount you may have outstanding at any one time. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of your Credit Line. However, if you temporarily exceed your Credit Line, you agree to repay the excess immediately, even if we have not yet billed you. Obtaining such credit does not increase your Credit Line. We retain the right to increase or decrease your Credit Line at any time. Any increase or reduction in the amount of your Credit Line will be shown on your monthly statement or by separate notice together with any changes in the applicable Minimum Monthly Payments. Your eligibility for this Credit Line is determined by our loan policy and may be terminated at our sole discretion, without demand or notice. You may close your Credit Line at any time by notifying us in writing and returning all Cards cut in half. If you terminate this Agreement or if we terminate or suspend your credit privileges, the provisions of this Agreement and your liability hereunder shall otherwise remain in full force and effect until you have paid us all sums due us under this Agreement and returned all Cards."
449,8,"4. Minimum Monthly Payment We will mail you a statement every month if your Account has a balance. You agree that you will pay each month not less than the minimum monthly payment on or before the closing date. The minimum monthly payment will be 3.0% of your outstanding balance shown on your statement (“New Balance”), or $25, whichever is greater. If your outstanding balance is less than $25, you agree to pay the balance in full. In addition to the minimum monthly payment, you agree to pay any “Overlimit Amount” and any amount past due shown on your statement each month by the due date shown on your Statement. You may pay in full for all your purchases and cash advances each month, or you may repay in monthly installments. We can accept late payments or partial payments, or checks, drafts, or money orders marked “payment in full” without prejudice to our rights under this Agreement, which are hereby explicitly reserved. A credit posting from a merchant or reversal of fees does not constitute a minimum payment. Payments will be applied first to interest and to fees, then to purchase balances, then to cash advance and balance transfer balances, and finally to any other charges or amounts owed. The minimum monthly payment may be allocated at the Credit Union’s discretion to pay off lower rate balances, such as promotional offers, before higher rate balances, such as cash advances or purchases. Payments in excess of the minimum monthly payment will be allocated first to higher rate balances, as applicable. From time to time, we may allow you to skip your minimum monthly payment due. If you choose to skip that payment, Interest Charges will continue to accrue in accordance with this Agreement. Payments received at: ELGA Credit Union, 2305 S. Center Rd., Burton, MI 48519 at or before 5:00 PM Eastern Time on any business day will be credited to your Account as of that date; payments received by mail at that address after 5:00 PM Eastern Time or on a weekend will be posted to your Account as of the next business day."
449,9,"5. Security Interest By signing your application, to secure your Account, you granted us a purchase money security interest under the Michigan Uni- ELGA Credit Union  Visa Credit Card Account Agreement © 2021 Farleigh Wada Witt. All rights reserved. Visa Credit Card Account Agreement & Disclosures • 05-11-21 • 2 form Commercial Code in any goods you purchase through your Account. If you default, we will have the right to recover any of these goods that have not been paid for through application of your payments in the manner described in Section 4. In addition, you granted us a security interest in all your shares and deposits, present and future, and all accounts (except Individual Retirement Accounts and Keogh Accounts) with the Credit Union to secure your Account and agree, upon default, the Credit Union may apply all that is secured to pay any amounts due under this Agreement, without further notice to you. You further agree that collateral securing other loans with the Credit Union (except loans secured by real property) also secures this Account."
449,10,"6. Periodic Statements Each month, if your outstanding balance exceeds $1, we will send you a statement showing new purchases, cash advances, payments, and credits made to your Account during the billing period, your Previous Balance, your ""Total New Balance,"" any Interest Charge, and any other charges. Your statement also will identify the remaining Credit Line available and the Minimum Monthly Payment you must make for that billing period and the date it is due. For statement verification purposes, you agree to retain copies of transaction slips resulting from each purchase, each advance, and other transaction on your Account. Unless you notify us of a billing error as described below, you accept your monthly statement as an accurate statement of your Account with us."
449,11,"7. Circumstances Under Which an Interest Charge Will Be Imposed The total outstanding balance of purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances in the Account on the closing date of a billing period, including any Interest Charge, will be shown on the Periodic Statement for that billing period as the ""New Balance."" a. Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. We begin charging an Interest Charge on cash advances and balance transfers from the date of each transaction. There is no time period within which to pay to avoid a periodic Interest Charge on cash advances or balance transfers. b. Purchases. Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. An Interest Charge will be imposed on the portion of purchases included in the New Balance that is not paid by the due date. This “grace period” allows you to avoid an Interest Charge on purchases for a billing period. If you do not pay the New Balance for purchases within the grace period, your Interest Charge will accrue on any unpaid purchase transactions from the first day of the billing period in which the payment is due."
449,12,"8. Method Used to Determine the Balance on Which the Interest Charge May Be Computed and Amount of Interest Charge The Credit Union figures the Interest Charge on your Account by multiplying the ""Average Daily Balance"" of purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances for your Account (including current transactions) by the Monthly Periodic Rate. To get the ""Average Daily Balance"" we take the beginning balance of your Account each day, add any new purchases or cash advances, and subtract any payments or credits, unpaid Interest Charge and unpaid late charges. However, current transactions are excluded from the Purchase balance. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ""Average Daily Balance."" To get the “Monthly Periodic Rate,” we divide the Annual Percentage Rate in effect for the billing period by 12."
449,13,"9. Periodic Rate and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rate a. Standard Rates. The Periodic Rate and corresponding Annual Percentage Rate(s) used to compute the Interest Charge are based on your credit profile and are disclosed to you in the Account Disclosure provided with this Agreement when you open your Account. b. Introductory Rates. At our discretion, we may offer you an introductory or promotional Annual Percentage Rate for your Account. Any introductory or promotional Annual Percentage Rate will be subject to the terms of the offer and this Agreement. We will provide you with information on the offer, including the time period the introductory or promotional Annual Percentage Rate is in effect in the Account Disclosure or in other materials that we send to you about the offer after you receive your Credit Card. c. Penalty Rate. If we do not receive a payment within 60 days of the date it is due, a penalty Annual Percentage Rate of 17.90% will be applied to all balances (current and future) on your Account. If you make six consecutive payments on or before their due dates, we will adjust your Annual Percentage Rate to the standard rate that would otherwise apply to your Account pursuant to this Agreement."
449,14,"10. Conditions Under Which Other Charges May Be Imposed You agree to pay the following fees and charges on your Account: a. Late Fee. If we do not receive your full minimum payment on or before the due date, you agree to pay a late fee of up to $25. b. Returned Item Fee. If any check or draft we receive from you as payment for any amount you owe to us is returned to us unpaid, you agree to pay a returned item fee of up to $25. c. Card Replacement Fee. You agree to pay $5 for each replacement Card you request. d. Pick-up Fee. If your Card has been blocked as lost or stolen and is recovered and you try to use it, you will be charged $75. e. Photocopy Fee. You will pay $1 per page for each copy of a statement or sales draft you request (unless the request relates to a billing error that we made). f. Attorney's Fees and Costs. If you fail to make any payment when due or are otherwise in default under any part of this Agreement, you agree to pay us all costs to collect your Account, including court costs and reasonable attorney fees whether or not there is a lawsuit, and fees on any appeal and fees for bankruptcy proceedings, appeals, and any post-judgment collection services, if applicable. These fees and costs may be added to your Account balance and will bear interest at the Annual Percentage Rate in effect at that time."
449,15,"11. Conditions of Card Use The use of your Card and Account are subject to the following conditions: a. Use. Your Card and Account may be used only for valid and lawful purposes. You may not use your Card (i) to make Purchases or obtain Cash Advances for any illegal transaction, or (ii) for any internet or online gambling transactions. If you use your Card for any illegal or prohibited transaction, this Agreement also applies to such transaction and you agree to pay any and all amounts related to such transaction pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. We may, at our sole discretion and without warning, restrict the use of or terminate your Card if we notice excessive use of your Card or other suspicious activities or if we reasonably believe the Card is or has been used for one or more illegal or prohibited transactions."

449,18,"d. Currency Conversion/International Transaction Fee. Purchases made in foreign countries will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. The currency conversion rate for international transactions, as established by Visa International, Inc., is a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. In addition, you will be charged an International Transaction Fee as set forth in the fee disclosure for any card transaction at a location in a foreign country or with a merchant located in a foreign country even if you initiate the transaction from within the United States."
449,19,"e. Notices and Payments. All notices will be sent to your address as shown in the application. You agree to advise us promptly if you change your mailing address.

We can delay enforcing any right under this Agreement without losing that right or any other right. We will notify you in writing of any such action as soon as practical if it occurs."

Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit."

However, if the New Balance shown on your monthly statement is less than $10.00, the entire New Balance will be due. If the minimum payment computed, as above, is not an even dollar amount, the minimum payment due may be rounded to the next highest dollar. You may at any time pay more than the minimum amount due. You may pay the new balance in whole or in part at any time. We will not charge you a penalty for paying more than the minimum payment.

Automatic payments that fall on a non-Business Day may be processed on the Business Day preceding the Payment Date. If the funds are not sufficient to pay your payment, the Credit Union may keep trying to make transfers of available funds each day until your entire payment is made; however, the Credit Union will not waive any rights to declare your loan in default by attempting to continue to make transfers. You may request to be removed from automatic payment transfer at any time by giving the Credit Union notice of your decision. We may require your notice to be confirmed in writing."
450,18,"IRREGULAR PAYMENTS: We may accept late payments, partial payments, or items marked “payment in full” or the like without losing any of our rights under this Agreement."
450,19,FINANCE CHARGES ON PURCHASES: We will impose a FINANCE CHARGE on your credit purchases if you do not pay the total New Balance as shown on your statement by the payment due date.
450,20,FINANCE CHARGES ON CASH ADVANCES: We will impose a FINANCE CHARGE on cash advances and balance transfers from the date of each cash advance or balance transfer transaction until the day we receive payment in full.
450,21,PAYING INTEREST: Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month. We will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date.
450,22,"MONTHLY STATEMENT: If you have a balance on your account at the end of the billing period, we will send you a statement. It will show the balance; any finance charges; fees; the minimum payment due and the payment due date. It will also show your current credit line; available credit; an itemized list of current charges; payments and credits and other important information. You must notify us of any change in your address so that we can properly direct the mailing of your statement."
450,23,"RETURNS AND ADJUSTMENTS: Merchants and others who honor the card may give you credit for returns and adjustments, and they will do so by sending us a credit slip which we will post to your account. If your credits and payments exceed what you owe us, we will hold and apply this credit balance against future purchases and cash advances, or if it is $1.00 or more, refund it upon your written request or automatically after three (3) months."
450,24,"DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE CHARGES: If you request documentary evidence of a transaction on your account (for example, a copy of a sales draft), we may pass along to you our cost of researching this evidence at the current rate as listed in our Fee Schedule. No such charge will be imposed unless the documentary evidence agrees with the transaction as previously reflected on your statement. In addition to the research fee, the fee for a copy of a sales draft is the current fee as listed in our Fee Schedule."

450,26,"LOST OR STOLEN CARDS, ACCOUNT NUMBERS: If a card or account number is lost or stolen, you must inform us immediately by calling 315.477.2200 or 800.462.5000 or by logging on to your online account at www.empowerfcu.com. You agree to inform us of the time, place and manner of loss or theft and of your name and credit card account number."
450,27,"COMPUTATION OF FINANCE CHARGES: We calculate the FINANCE CHARGE on your account as follows: The “daily periodic rate” times the num- ber of days in the billing cycle times the “average daily balance” of your account subject to FINANCE CHARGES (including current transactions subject to finance charges). The “daily periodic rate” is calculated by dividing the APR by the number of days in the year. Your APR may vary. Rates are determined and adjusted monthly on the first day of the billing cycle by adding a Margin to the highest Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the last business day of each month. The Margin is determined based on an evaluation of each accountholder’s credit history. The “average daily balance” for the period is determined by taking the beginning balance of your account each day, adding any new purchases or advances and deducting any payments or credits and unpaid FINANCE CHARGES. This gives us the “daily balance”. We then add up all the daily balances for the billing period and divide that total by the number of days in the billing period."
450,28,"CANCELLATION: You may cancel your account at any time by notifying us, in writing, and delivering the card(s) to us. The card(s) at all times remains our property, and must be surrendered immediately upon our request. Upon cancellation, you remain obligated to repay all amounts due under this Agreement. We may reduce your credit limit and cancel the account altogether. Unless you are in default, we will give you notice of any such reduction or cancellation. We may also cancel your account by not sending you a renewal card upon expiration at any time based upon our lending guidelines. We may also reissue a different card, account number, at any time. Regardless of whether your account has been cancelled, no card may be used after the expiration date indicated on the card."
450,29,"LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE: If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card, you should write to us or call us immediately at the address or telephone number listed on your statement. You will be liable for unauthorized use of your credit card in cases where you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your account or card when your card was used with your PIN. You will not be liable for an unauthorized transaction by the use of your card. You will not, in any case, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us at the address or telephone number listed on your statement; however, you must identify, for us, the charges on the billing statement that were not made by you, someone authorized by you, and from which you received no benefit. Use which includes use of your PIN or which includes your negligence or fraud are considered by us as “authorized use”."

We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.

To use this right, all of the following must be true: The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50.

The term ""Cardholder"" means each person who signed and returned the Application and any other person who has agreed to be responsible for the Account (defined below). As used in this Agreement, the term “person” means an individual or an entity, as applicable. By Cardholder's use of the credit card (""Card""), furnished by Bank in reliance in part upon the information supplied by Cardholder in the Application, Cardholder agrees with Bank as follows:"
501,2,"Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving triparty account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans (""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be obtained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank. All Credit Purchases and Cash Advances are effected at the option of the retail merchant (""Seller"") and/or cash advancing financial institution respectively, and Bank shall not be responsible for refusal by any Seller or cash advancing financial institution to honor the Card or any ""Related Card,"" as defined in paragraph 2 below."
501,3,"Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Cardholder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder receives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Account number that has been issued to another person by reason of such person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandatory provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth later in this Agreement."
501,4,"Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a transaction which results in Cardholder’s total outstanding balance (plus authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be considered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this Agreement"
501,5,"Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Cardholder provides or to any number 
where Bank may reasonably believe Bank can contact cardholder, 
including calls to mobile, cellular, or similar devices, and calls using 
automatic telephone dialing systems and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address where Bank reasonably 
believes Bank can contact Cardholder. Calls and messages may 
be made for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to: suspected fraud or identity theft; obtaining information; Cardholder's 
account transactions or servicing; collecting on Cardholder's account; and providing Cardholder information about products and 
services"
501,6,". Periodic Statement. As of the end of each monthly billing cycle, Cardholder will be furnished a periodic statement showing, among other things, (a) the amount owed (""Previous Balance"") at the beginning of the billing cycle, (b) the amount of all Cash Advances, Credit Purchases and Finance Charge posted to the Account during the billing cycle, (c) the amount of all payments and credits posted to the Account during the billing cycle, and (d) the total amount due (""New Balance"") at the end of the billing cycle (which amount is the sum of [a] and [b] less [c]), (e) the ""Minimum Payment,"" and (f) the ""Payment Due Date."" If Cardholder is composed of more than one person, only one periodic statement will be provided."
501,7,"Minimum Payment. Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected on the next periodic statement. The Payment Due Date for a billing cycle will be not less than twenty-five (25) days after the preceding billing cycle ends (the ""Closing Date"")."
501,8,Annual Fee. Bank does not charge an annual fee for the Card.
501,9,"Late Payment Fee. If Bank does not receive a payment from Cardholder in at least the amount of the Minimum Payment within 30 days after the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, Bank may charge Cardholder a late payment fee in the amount stated below in the Table of Charges. Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Payment Due Date"
501,10,"Cash Advance Fee. Each time Cardholder uses the Card or a Convenience Check to obtain a Cash Advance, Bank will assess a cash advance fee in the amount stated in the Table of Charges"
501,11,"When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transaction(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time."
501,12,"Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and payments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Account that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate which is .007083."
501,13,Annual Percentage Rate (APR) 8.50% for Cash Advances and/or Credit Purchases. (The APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate)**
501,14,Default APR and When It Applies 18% This APR may be applied to Cardholder's account when the full balance becomes due and payable and Cardholder has been notified of the APR increase.
501,15,Paying Interest Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank will not charge any interest on purchases if Cardholder pays the entire balance by the Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin charging interest on Cash Advances on the transaction date.

501,21,BILLING RIGHTS: Information on Cardholder’s rights to dispute transactions and how to exercise those rights are included in this Agreement. See “Your Billing Rights” section in this Agreement.
501,22,"12. Other Payment Terms. All payments received on or before (a) 5 o'clock p.m. (Fort Worth, Texas time) on Bank's business day at the address indicated on the periodic statement, or (b) the closing time of the applicable branch if payment is made in person, will be credited to the Account as of the date of receipt of payment. If payment is made at any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or waiving any of Bank’s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be applied in the following order:  Unpaid Finance Charge;  Late Fee;  Cash Advance from previous billing cycle;  Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle;  Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and  Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. If two APRs apply to Cardholder’s balance, after payment of accrued Finance Charges and late fees, Bank will allocate the rest of the payment to the balance which has the higher APR."
501,23,"Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Convenience Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Convenience Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a Convenience Check"
501,24,"Transaction Limits. Bank may establish limits on the amount Cardholder may borrow or the types of transactions Bank will permit, such as one or more of the following:  Cash Advance, Balance Transfer, or Purchase Limits which is the maximum balance for each type of transaction Cardholder may have.  Daily limits which are limits on the number or total dollar amount of certain transactions that Bank will authorize in a single day.  Location limits which are certain geographic or merchant locations where Bank may not permit transactions to be made usually due to a higher risk of fraud or illegal activity.  Legal limits or limits on the use of an Account Bank deems necessary to comply with the law or prevent liability to Bank or anyone else.  Other limits which Bank may establish to prevent fraud or losses on the Account or to protect Bank, its members, vendors, affiliates, or other persons. Bank will advise Cardholder about some of the limits such as Cardholder’s credit limit; however, for security and other reasons Bank will not tell Cardholder about all the limits Bank sets. Cardholder agrees not to exceed the limits of which it has been informed or allow the Account to exceed those limits. Bank can increase, reduce, cancel, or suspend any of the limits or add new limits at any time."
501,25,"Termination. Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a Cash Advance after Card-holder has been notified that Cardholder's privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all Cards and Convenience Checks previously issued on the Account must be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to 
terminate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Cardholder's existing obligations under this Agreement or 
Cardholder's liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account 
prior to the time all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned 
to Bank. When the Account is closed, Cardholder must contact 
everyone authorized to charge transactions to the Account, such 
as internet service providers, health clubs or insurance companies. 
These transactions may continue to be charged to the Account until 
Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempting to use Cardholder’s Account after Cardholder has requested to close the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to

In your letter, give us the following information:  Account information: Your name and Account number.  Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.  Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us:  Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.  At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question."
501,48,"WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:  We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.  The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.  While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.  We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit."
501,49,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:  If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.  If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

As used in this Agreement, the term “person” means an individual or an entity, as applicable.

502,2,"Using the Account. Cardholder has accepted the revolving triparty account (""Account"") made available to Cardholder by Bank. Cardholder may use the Card to purchase or lease goods or services, or pay amounts that Cardholder owes, wherever the Card is honored (""Credit Purchases""). Cardholder may also use the Card to obtain cash loans (""Cash Advances"") from any financial institution that accepts the Card. Cardholder agrees that the Account will not be used to access gambling web sites or to purchase illegal goods or services. Bank may refuse to process any transaction that Bank believes may violate this Agreement. If Cardholder provides the Account number to make a purchase or obtain an advance without presenting the Card (such as for a mail order or telephone purchase), or if Cardholder authorizes someone else to make a charge to the Account, Cardholder's obligation to pay will be the same as if the Card itself was used. Cash Advances also may be obtained through use of the Card (a) upon execution of a written request of Cardholder in a form furnished by any financial institution that is a member, alone or in association with others, of Visa, Inc. or (b) upon Cardholder's execution of a written separate agreement with Bank for a Visa overdraft financial agreement, if offered by Bank.

502,3,"Obligations on the Account. Cardholder (jointly or severally if more than one) promises to pay Bank at the address specified on the periodic statement (see paragraph 5 below) for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances, together with any Finance Charge as herein provided, plus any other charges permitted by this Agreement, all such payments must be in lawful money of the United States of America. Cardholder will pay in their equivalent in U.S. dollars all charges in a foreign currency, which equivalence will be determined by reference to the amount in U.S. dollars. Bank shall have paid in good faith to the person presenting the item to Bank. Cardholder shall be liable and agrees to pay Bank for Credit Purchases made by, or for Cash Advances extended to, Cardholder or anyone else using the Card unless the use of such Card is by a person other than the Cardholder (a) who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use and (b) from which Cardholder receives no benefit. Additionally, Cardholder shall be jointly and severally liable, and agrees to pay, for all Credit Purchases and Cash Advances obtained through the use of any other Card bearing Cardholder's Account number that has been issued to another person by reason of such person being a member of Cardholder's family, or otherwise issued upon Cardholder's request (all such Cards bearing the same Account number hereinafter collectively called ""Related Cards""). Subject to any mandatory provisions of applicable law, all payments made by Cardholder will be applied to the balances on Cardholder's Account in the manner set forth later in this Agreement."
502,4,"Credit Limit. Bank will inform Cardholder from time to time of the maximum amount of debt (""Credit Limit"") that may be outstanding in the Account at any time, and Bank, in its sole discretion may adjust the Credit Limit from time to time. Cardholder agrees not to use or permit the use of the Card in any manner that would cause the outstanding balance in the Account ever to exceed the Credit Limit. If Cardholder attempts a transaction which results in Cardholder’s total outstanding balance (plus authorizations) exceeding Cardholder's Credit Limit, Bank may: (a) permit the transaction without raising Cardholder's Credit Limit; (b) permit the transaction and treat the amount of the transaction that is more than the Credit Limit as immediately due; or (c) refuse to permit the transaction. If Bank refuses to permit the transaction, Bank may advise the person who attempted the transaction that it has been refused. If Bank has previously permitted Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit Limit, it does not mean that Bank will permit Cardholder to exceed Cardholder's Credit Limit on a subsequent date. Bank may designate that only a portion of Cardholder's Credit Limit is available for Cash Advances. If Cardholder exceeds that limit, Cardholder will be considered to have exceeded the Credit Limit for all purposes under this Agreement"
502,5,"Notices. Bank will send periodic statements and any other notices to Cardholder at the address shown in Bank's files. If this is a joint Account, Bank can send periodic statements and notices to either Cardholder. Cardholder promises to inform Bank promptly, in writing, of any changes in Cardholder's address. Cardholder authorizes Bank, or anyone acting on Bank's behalf, to call or send a text message to any number Cardholder provides or to any number 
where Bank may reasonably believe Bank can contact cardholder, 
including calls to mobile, cellular, or similar devices, and calls using 
automatic telephone dialing systems and/or pre-recorded messages, or to send an email to any address where Bank reasonably

Cardholder agrees to pay to Bank, on or prior to the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement, the sum of (a) either (i) the entire New Balance or (ii) at Cardholder's option, an amount which shall be at least 2.50% of the New Balance (rounded up to the nearest dollar) or $50.00, whichever is greater, and (b) any amount that is past due and any amount that is over the Credit Limit. If the New Balance is less than $50.00, it shall be paid in full. Cardholder may pay more than the Minimum Payment, and may at any time pay the full amount owing to Bank. If Cardholder pays more than the Minimum Payment, Cardholder must still pay the Minimum Payment as reflected on the next periodic statement.

Cardholder will only be charged a late payment fee for any Minimum Payment which is not paid within 30 days after the Payment Due Date."
502,11,"When Finance Charge Begins. Bank adds a Finance Charge to the Account for all Cash Advances from the later of (a) the day the Cash Advance is posted to the Account, or (b) the first day of the billing cycle in which the Cash Advance is posted until Cardholder pays the transaction(s) in full. For Credit Purchases, Bank adds a Finance Charge to the Account if the Cardholder does not pay the New Balance in full by the Payment Due Date shown on the periodic statement. If Bank adds a Finance Charge, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge on all amounts Cardholder owes Bank (except ""New Purchases"") from the first day of the billing cycle; provided, however, any portion of the New Balance subject to a grace period that is paid prior to the expiration of the grace period will not be assessed a Finance Charge. For New Purchases, Bank begins to charge the Finance Charge from the date Bank posts the New Purchase to the Account unless Cardholder has paid the New Balance in full on the previous periodic statement. A New Purchase is one that appears on the periodic statement for the first time."
502,12,"Calculation of Finance Charge. Bank calculates the Finance Charge on the Account by applying the ""Periodic Rate"" (defined below) to the ""Average Daily Balance"" of the Account. To obtain the Average Daily Balance, Bank starts with the beginning balance of the Account on each day, excluding unpaid Finance Charges. Bank adds any Cash Advances posted to the Account that day, and any New Purchases, unless Cardholder paid the New Balance in full for the previous billing cycle by the Payment Due Date. Bank subtracts any credits and payments (after any unpaid Finance Charges are paid) posted to the Account that day. This results in the ""Daily Balance."" Then, Bank adds up all the Daily Balances for the billing cycle and divides that by the total number of days in the billing cycle. This results in the Average Daily Balance. The Finance Charge on the Account is calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Periodic Rate which is .010417."
502,13,Annual Percentage Rate (APR) 12.50% for Cash Advances and/or Credit Purchases. (The APR will vary with the market based on the Prime Rate)**
502,14,Default APR and When It Applies 18% This APR may be applied to Cardholder's account when the full balance becomes due and payable and Cardholder has been notified of the APR increase
502,15,Paying Interest Cardholder's Payment Due Date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing cycle. Bank will not charge any interest on purchases if Cardholder pays the entire balance by the Payment Due Date each month. Bank will begin charging interest on Cash Advances on the transaction date.

502,20,"HOW BANK WILL CALCULATE CARDHOLDER’S BALANCE: Bank uses the average daily balance method (including new transactions). See “Calculation of Finance Charge” section in this Agreement. For Credit Purchases and Cash Advances, the APR varies with changes to the Prime Rate. The “Prime Rate” is the highest prime rate published in the Money Rates column of the Wall Street Jour- New Classic Account (1/1/2016) nal 30 days before the Closing Date on Cardholder’s periodic statement (the “Calculation Date”). On January 1, 2016, the Prime Rate was 3.50% therefore the APR was 12.50% as to Credit Purchases and Cash Advances. The APR will go up and down depending on the Prime Rate as of each Calculation Date; however, the APR is subject to change only on the first day of each billing cycle. If the Prime Rate and the corresponding APR increase, the Finance Charge also will increase and Cardholder’s Minimum Payment may also increase. The Prime Rate is only a pricing index and is not the lowest interest rate available"

If payment is made at any other location, credit for the payment may be delayed up to 5 days. Bank can accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that are marked with ""Paid In Full"" or any other similar language without losing or waiving any of Bank’s rights or Cardholder's obligations under this Agreement. Payment by check constitutes Cardholder's authorization for Bank to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Cardholder's bank to make such payment. Bank is not responsible for any lost or stolen cash payments. Payments and credits to the Account will be applied in the following order:  Unpaid Finance Charge;  Late Fee;  Cash Advance from previous billing cycle;  Credit Purchases from previous billing cycle;  Cash Advances from current billing cycle; and  Credit Purchases from current billing cycle. If two APRs apply to Cardholder’s balance, after payment of accrued Finance Charges and late fees, Bank will allocate the rest of the payment to the balance which has the higher APR."
502,23,"Convenience Checks. Bank may issue ""Convenience Checks"" to Cardholder that may be used to access the Account. Use of a Convenience Check will be treated as a Cash Advance in the amount of the Check. Each Convenience Check will contain Cardholder's Account Number, and may be used only by the person(s) whose name(s) is/are printed on it. Each Convenience Check must be completed and signed in the same way as a regular personal check. If Bank provides Convenience Checks for the Account, Cardholder may not use them to pay any amount Cardholder owes under this Agreement. Cardholder agrees that Bank need not return Convenience Checks to Cardholder after their use, and that, if Cardholder needs evidence of any payment represented by the Convenience Check, a photocopy or similar reproduction will be satisfactory for such purposes. If Cardholder wishes to prevent payment of a Convenience Check, the instructions which Bank provides when the Convenience Checks are issued must be followed. In the event payment of a Convenience Check has been stopped, Cardholder agrees to hold Bank harmless and indemnify Bank for any losses, expenses and costs, including attorney's fees incurred by Bank, for preventing payment of any Convenience Check. Bank will use its best efforts to stop payment, but will incur no liability to Cardholder if it is unable to stop payment on a Convenience Check."
502,24,"Transaction Limits. Bank may establish limits on the amount Cardholder may borrow or the types of transactions Bank will permit, such as one or more of the following:  Cash Advance, Balance Transfer, or Purchase Limits which is the maximum balance for each type of transaction Cardholder may have.  Daily limits which are limits on the number or total dollar amount of certain transactions that Bank will authorize in a single day.  Location limits which are certain geographic or merchant locations where Bank may not permit transactions to be made usually due to a higher risk of fraud or illegal activity.  Legal limits or limits on the use of an Account Bank deems necessary to comply with the law or prevent liability to Bank or anyone else.  Other limits which Bank may establish to prevent fraud or losses on the Account or to protect Bank, its members, vendors, affiliates, or other persons. Bank will advise Cardholder about some of the limits such as Cardholder’s credit limit; however, for security and other reasons Bank will not tell Cardholder about all the limits Bank sets. Cardholder agrees not to exceed the limits of which it has been informed or allow the Account to exceed those limits.

Bank may terminate Cardholder's privileges under this Agreement or limit Cardholder's right to make Credit Purchases or receive Cash Advances at any time (and list Cardholder's Account in warning bulletins in the event of such termination) without any reason or without advance notice or resulting liability. If Bank requests, Cardholder must return the Card and Convenience Checks to Bank. Cardholder agrees that Cardholder will not try to make a Credit Purchase or obtain a Cash Advance after Cardholder has been notified that Cardholder's privilege to use the Account has been terminated. Cardholder may terminate this Agreement at any time. If Cardholder does terminate, all Cards and Con-venience Checks previously issued on the Account must be returned to Bank. If Cardholder telephones Bank with the termination 
request, Bank may require that Cardholder confirm such intent to 
terminate in writing. Bank's or Cardholder's termination will not affect Cardholder's existing obligations under this Agreement or 
Cardholder's liability for all charges posted to Cardholder's Account 
prior to the time all Cards and Convenience Checks are returned 
to Bank. When the Account is closed, Cardholder must contact 
everyone authorized to charge transactions to the Account, such 
as internet service providers, health clubs or insurance companies. 
These transactions may continue to be charged to the Account until 
Cardholder changes the billing. Also, if the Bank believes Cardholder has authorized a transaction or is attempting to use Cardholder’s Account after Cardholder has requested to close the Account, Bank may allow the transaction to be charged to the Account. If the Account is terminated by Cardholder or by Bank for 
reasons other than Cardholder's default, Cardholder will be required to pay the outstanding balance on the Account according to 
the terms of this Agreement immediately prior to such termination."

Bank, upon such default, may at its election (a) decline to extend further credit under this Agreement (and Cardholder agrees not to make further Credit Purchases or to obtain further Cash Advances) and (b) declare all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder immediately due and payable, without prior notice or demand of any kind, except as may be required by applicable law. After Bank declares all amounts then owed to Bank by Cardholder to be due and payable, and terminates Cardholder’s credit privileges under the Account Bank, at its option (but only after providing to Cardholder notice if such is required by applicable law), may increase the Annual Percentage Rate up to 18%, which is the Default Rate under the Table of Charges."
502,27,"Collection Charges. If Cardholder defaults, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Cardholder agrees to pay (a) all amounts actually incurred by Bank as court costs and attorneys' fees set by a court in connection with the collection of amounts due by Cardholder under the Account and (b) premiums or other identifiable charges received in connection with the permitted sale of insurance. In addition, Bank may impose on Cardholder a processing fee of $20.00 if a check provided to Bank by Cardholder is dishonored for any reason. The dishonored check processing fee may be added to the New Balance and is payable on the next following due date, however, such fee will not accrue any Finance Charge"

Cardholder will not be liable for unauthorized use that occurs after Cardholder notifies Bank of the loss or theft of the Card or Convenience Check, or the possible unauthorized use of the Account. Bank may terminate or limit access to the Account if Cardholder has notified Bank, or if Bank has determined that the Card or Convenience Check may have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to the Account.

You must contact us:  Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.  At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question."
502,48,"errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:  We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.  The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.  While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.  We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit."
502,49,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:  If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.  If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been set If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay 
the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct."

You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card Account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.

503,1,"This Consumer Credit Card Agreement and Disclosure together with the Account Opening Disclosure and any other Account opening documents or any subsequent documents provided to You related to this Account (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Agreement”) govern the terms and conditions of this Account. “We,” “Us,” “Our” and “Ours” and “Credit Union” refers to First Commonwealth Federal Credit Union with which this Agreement is made. “You,” “Your,” and “Yours” refers to each applicant and co-applicant for the Account; any person responsible for paying the Account; and anyone You authorize to use, access or service the Account. ""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, including convenience checks, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card."
503,2,"SECURITY INTEREST You grant the Credit Union a security interest under the Uniform Commercial Code and under any common law rights the Credit Union may have in any goods You purchase. If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. You grant Us a security interest in all individual and joint share and/or deposit accounts You have with Us now and in the future to secure Your credit card Account. Shares and deposits in an IRA or any other account that would lose special tax treatment under state or federal law if given as security are not subject to the security interest You have given in Your shares and deposits. You may withdraw these other shares unless You are in default. When You are in default, You authorize Us to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. For example, if You have an unpaid credit card balance, You agree We may use funds in Your account(s) to pay any or all of the unpaid balance. You acknowledge and agree that Your pledge does not apply during any periods when You are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act. For clarity, You will not be deemed a covered borrower, and Your pledge will apply, if: (i) You established Your credit card Account when You were not a covered borrower; or (ii) You cease to be a covered borrower. Unless otherwise prohibited by federal and/or state law, collateral securing other loans You have with the Credit Union may also secure this loan, except that a dwelling will never be considered as security for this Account, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Agreement."
503,3,"USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions."
503,4,"CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law"
503,5,"CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give Us a reasonable opportunity to act on Your request. In addition, Your request must 
accurately describe the check including the exact Account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, 
and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, You may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will 
expire after 14 days unless You confirm Your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective 
only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment 
order be renewed. We are not required to notify You when a stop payment order expires. 
If We re-credit Your Account after paying a check over a valid and timely stop payment order, You agree to sign a 
statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to Us all of Your rights against the payee or other holders of 
the check and to assist Us in any legal action. 
You agree to indemnify and hold Us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, 
related to Our honoring Your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect 
information provided to Us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. Note: A convenience 
check is not a check as that term is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code. It is an advance from Your credit card 
Account with Us and Your stop payment rights are provided under this Agreement with Us."
503,6,"REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $25.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $25.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us"
503,7,"INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction or the first day of the billing cycle in which the transaction is posted to Your Account, whichever is later (transaction date). However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement."
503,8,"How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type"
503,9,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement."

The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date."

The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement"
503,12,"AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account."

Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us."
503,14,"PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason.

Unless disclosed otherwise, the Credit Union will not allow advances over the credit limit. If the Credit Union has a program whereby it allows payment of advances that exceed your credit limit, subject to a fee, the Credit Union will provide you with notice, either orally, in writing, or electronically (notwithstanding the requirements of the paragraph entitled “Statements and Notices”) explaining your right to opt in to the Credit Union’s program whereby it will honor advance requests over the credit limit. In the event you opt in to such a program, you agree to the terms of such a program. You may request an increase in your credit limit only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. The Credit Union may increase or decrease your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate your account at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. If you are permitted to obtain cash advances on your account, we may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to you that may be drawn on your account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on your account balance. If you use a convenience check, it will be posted to your account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on your account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that we stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on your account. You agree to pay any fee imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on your account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on your request. In addition, your request must accurately describe the check including the exact account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check.

Written stop payment orders are effective only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify you when a stop payment order expires. If we re-credit your account after paying a check or draft over a valid and timely stop payment order, you agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to us all of your rights against the payee or other holders of the check or draft and to assist us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to our honoring your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request"

504,5,"PERIODIC RATES — The periodic rates applicable to purchases, cash advances, and balance transfers are disclosed on the Disclosure that accompanies this Agreement. Any penalty rate that may be imposed for failing to make a payment by the payment due date is also disclosed on the Disclosure. Any rate change will be made pursuant to applicable law. If the rate for your account is variable, as indicated on the accompanying Disclosure, the rate charged on purchases, cash advances, balance transfers and any penalty rate will vary periodically as disclosed in the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. The initial rate on your account for certain types of transactions may be an introductory discounted rate (Introductory Rate) that is lower than the rate that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction. If an Introductory Rate applies to your account, the rates and the period of time it will be effective is shown on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. After the Introductory Rate period expires, the periodic rate will automatically increase to the rates that would ordinarily apply for that type of transaction based on the terms of this Agreement."
504,6,"FINANCE CHARGES — New purchases posted to your account during a billing cycle will not incur a finance charge for that billing cycle if you had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or you paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the payment due date of that statement; otherwise a finance charge will accrue from the date a purchase is posted to your account. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, you must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the payment due date of that statement. A finance charge begins to accrue on cash advances from the date you get the cash advance or from the first day of the billing cycle in which the cash advance is posted to your account, whichever is later (transaction date). The finance charge is calculated separately for purchases and cash advances. For purchases, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of purchases. To calculate the average daily balance of purchases, we take the beginning outstanding balance of purchases each day, add any new purchases, and subtract any payments and/or credits. This gives us the daily balance of purchases. We then add all of the daily balances of purchases for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of purchases. For cash advances, the finance charge is computed by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of cash advances. To calculate the average daily balance of cash advances, we take the beginning outstanding balance of cash advances each day, add in any new cash advances, and subtract any payments and/or credits that we apply to the cash advance balance. This gives us the daily balance of cash advances. We then add all of the daily balances of cash advances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance of cash advances. Balance transfers are calculated in the same manner as cash advances."
504,7,"FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from your account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions to U.S. dollars is either a government-mandated exchange rate or a wholesale exchange rate and is selected by MasterCard. The rate MasterCard uses for a particular transaction is the rate MasterCard selects for the applicable currency on the day the transaction is processed. This rate may differ from the rate applicable on the date the transaction occurred or was posted to your account. A fee (finance charge) will be charged on all transactions completed outside of the United States, where the cardholder’s country code differs from the merchant’s country code. All fees are calculated based on the transaction amount after it is converted to U.S. dollars. These fees are charged except where excluded. The Foreign Transaction Fee is set forth on the Disclosure accompanying this Agreement"
504,8,"FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, the following additional fees may be imposed on your account.

504,14,"PIN Replacement Fee. If your account is subject to a PIN Replacement Fee, a fee will be charged to your account whenever you request a new PIN number for your account."

We may not send you a bill, however, if we have decided your Account is uncollectible, if we have sent the Account for collection proceedings against you, or if the law does not require or permit us to send the bill.

Your due date will be at least 21 days from the date we send you the bill and at least 25 days from the end of the most recently ended billing period. To be on time, we must receive your payment on or before the due date at the place and by the time stated on your bill.

Box 268808, Oklahoma City, OK 73126 (regular mail); or HC Processing Center, 380 Data Drive, Suite 200, Draper, UT 84020 (overnight courier). Unless a bill states a different time, your payment is on time if we receive it by 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the due date. This 5:00 p.m. deadline is measured by the time zone in which we receive the payment, which may not be your time zone. If we do not receive or accept payments by mail on the due date, your payment will be on time if it is received by the next day that we accept or receive payments by mail. You must pay in U.S. dollars. You must not pay in cash. Your payment must be drawn on a U.S. deposit account or by a cashier’s check drawn on a U.S. bank or a foreign bank branch in the U.S. You must not attach or include any restrictive language to your payment.

505,17,"Minimum Payment: The bill we send to you will state your due date and the minimum amount you must pay by that due date (your “minimum payment” or the “minimum payment due” in this Agreement and on your bill). If you do not pay the minimum payment by its due date, we may charge you a late payment fee. You will also be in breach of this Agreement. You may pay all or part of your Account balance at any time. However, for each bill, you must pay at least the minimum payment by the due date stated on the bill. If any Promotional Terms apply that modify the payment requirements with respect to a Promotional Balance, then those Promotional Terms will explain how we determine the minimum payment due with respect to these Promotional Balances. As of the end of the billing period covered by the bill, we start by determining the amount that is the greater of: (i) the full unpaid balance of your Account, if this is less than $25.00; (ii) $25.00, if the balance is at least $25.00; (iii) 3.5% of the Highest Balance (excluding any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms make those Promotional Balances subject to different payment requirements). Then, we determine the minimum payment due for any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms modify the payment requirements for these Promotional Balances; or (iv) the sum of 1.0% of the Highest Balance (excluding any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms make those Promotional Balances subject to different payment requirements), plus all interest charges, late payment fees, and returned payment fees then due for the Account. Then, we determine whether there are any Account payments that are past due or balances that exceed the credit limit of your Account. Finally, we calculate your minimum payment due by adding together all the amounts described in this paragraph and rounding the result up to the nearest whole dollar. If you pay more than the minimum payment due after the end of any billing period, you must still pay at least the minimum payment due after the end of each billing period after that."
505,18,"Payment Allocation: We choose which Account balances to pay with your minimum payment. We generally apply payments above the minimum payment to balances with the highest APRs first, except that we may apply the part of your payment that exceeds the minimum payment first to any deferred interest balances during the last two billing periods of a deferred interest period"
505,19,"TYPES OF CHARGES: There are two types of charges or “Plans” under your Account: you may make a purchase on (a) the Regular Plan or (b) a Promotional Plan. The standard provisions of this Agreement apply to all Promotional Plan transactions unless otherwise specified prior to or at the time of purchase under a particular Promotional Plan offering, and will continue to apply to any and all transactions that are not subject to a Promotional Plan. The following Promotional Plan may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: Deferred Interest (a) Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, interest charges will be imposed from the purchase date. (b) Reduced Interest Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, reduced interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not made, the fully indexed APR will be imposed from the default date forward."
505,20,"APRs Applied to Different Balances: The “annual percentage rate” or “APR” is an annualized interest rate. We use the APR that applies to each balance to calculate the interest charges that you owe us on the Account. Different APRs may apply to different balances on your Account, such as purchases subject to the standard APR and any qualifying purchases we may allow you to make subject to deferred interest or a promotional APR."
505,21,"Variable APRs: All your Account APRs are variable, unless we specifically state that a non-variable APR applies in connection with a deferred interest or promotional APR program. Variable APRs increase or decrease based on changes in the Prime Rate. For the Prime Rate, we use the U.S. Prime Rate that The Wall Street Journal publishes on the Friday that follows the last Thursday of each month (the “Determination Date”). If The Wall Street Journal no longer publishes a Prime Rate, we will use a similar published rate that we choose as a substitute. Any increase or decrease to a variable APR based on a change in the Prime Rate will apply to your Account balances and purchases as of the first day of the billing period that begins after a Determination Date. Any increase in an APR that applies to your Account may cause an increase to your minimum required monthly payment."
505,22,"Standard APR: We determine your standard APR by adding a margin of 24.49 percentage points to the Prime Rate. Currently, the standard APR of 29.99% applies to your account (corresponding to a Daily Periodic Rate of 0.082164%)."
505,23,"Use of Daily Balance Method with Compounding: We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the “daily periodic rate” for that balance to the “daily balance” of that balance. We do this for each day in the billing period and add together the resulting interest charges. That gives us the total interest charges for that balance for that billing period. You agree that we may round interest charges to the nearest cent. The “daily periodic rate” is a daily interest rate. The daily periodic rate for a given balance is equal to the APR for that balance divided by 365. We calculate the “daily balance” for each balance. We do this by starting with the beginning amount of that balance for each day. We add any new purchases and Account fees for that day, add any interest on the previous daily balance if there is one in that billing period, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the “daily balance.” The addition of the prior day’s interest to the daily balance calculation causes interest to compound daily. We add all Account fees and minimum interest charges to the daily balance of purchases subject to the standard APR. Any daily balance that is less than zero will be treated as zero. Each “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” shown on your bill will be an average of the daily balances during the billing period for that balance"
505,24,"When Interest Charges Begin; Grace Period: The “New Balance” of your Account is the full unpaid balance of your Account that is outstanding as of the end of each billing period covered by each bill. As long as you continue to pay the New Balance every month by the due date listed on your bill, there will be a grace period on your Account purchases and we will not charge interest on those purchases. If you do not pay by the due date the New Balance that is outstanding as of the end of a given billing period, there will be no grace period and you will owe interest on the unpaid Account balances from the end of that billing period. After the end of that billing period, all charges will accrue interest from the date they were made. To take advantage of the grace period again, you must pay your New Balance in full, make no new purchases, and pay on time for as much as two billing periods in a row."
505,25,Minimum Interest Charges: You must pay a minimum of $2.00 of interest after any billing period in which you owe any interest charges.
505,26,"Annual Fee: In the first billing period your Account has a purchase, we will charge a $59.00 annual fee to your Account. Thereafter you will be charged this annual fee on or about the anniversary of the first charge to your Account (your “Anniversary Date”), so long as your account has an unpaid balance or remains open for new purchases. We will notify you about this annual fee before each Anniversary Date. Our notice will explain when and how you may close your Account to future purchases and pay the full unpaid balance if you do not want to be charged this annual fee on an Anniversary Date"
505,27,"Returned Payment Fee: If your payment is returned unpaid to us for any reason, we will charge up to a $28.00 returned payment fee to your Account. If your payments are returned unpaid more than once during any six-month period, we will charge up to a $39.00 returned payment fee to your Account. After that, your returned payment fee will not return to $28.00 until you make Account payments required by the Agreement that are paid in full for six consecutive months"
505,28,"Late Payment Fee: If you do not pay at least the minimum payment due by its due date, we will charge a $28.00 late payment fee to your Account. If you do not pay the minimum payments due by their due dates more than once during any six-month period, we will charge a $39.00 late payment fee to your Account. After that, your late payment fee will not return to $28.00, until you make at least the minimum payment due by its due date for six consecutive months."
505,29,"Additional Account Fees: We will charge additional fees to your Account for certain services that you may request in connection with your Account. The additional fees we may charge to your Account for Account services include, but are not limited to, the following: a $10.00 per page fee for copies of documents unrelated to a billing error; a $5.00 fee to issue a replacement Card; a $9.95 expedited payment fee each time you request expedited assistance from our live customer service representative or agent to make an automated payment of your Account; and a $15.00 expedited service fee each time you request expedited assistance from us for reasons other than completing an Account payment (for example, to request an Account balance or payoff letter from us within three business days). You may contact us at 877-486-3442 at any time with questions about these and other Account services, or to request a schedule of other Account fees that we may require for particular services that are not listed here"
505,30,"CREDIT LIMIT: We will establish a credit limit for your Account. We may increase or decrease your Credit Line without notice. We may delay increasing your available credit by the amount of any payment that we receive for up to 14 days. You agree that you will not use or permit others to use your Account to obtain credit if it would cause the outstanding balance of your Account to exceed its credit limit. However, we may, at our option, without waiving any of our rights, permit charges to your Account, even if those charges would cause your outstanding Account balance to exceed its credit limit. We will not assess a fee if we elect to honor charges that cause your Account to exceed its credit limit"
505,31,"ENTIRE BALANCE DUE: If you break your promises under this Agreement, you understand and agree that we may demand that you pay the entire outstanding balance of your Account at once, subject to any legally required notices and limitations of applicable law. We may also do this if you made any false or misleading statements on your application, if you become insolvent or are subject to bankruptcy proceedings, or if you die, to the extent permitted by and in accordance with applicable law."
505,32,"COLLECTION COSTS: To the extent permitted by law, you promise to pay all the costs we incur to collect your Account, including reasonable and allowable attorney’s fees."
505,33,"JOINT ACCOUNTS: If this is a joint Account, each of you is responsible as an individual and all of you are responsible as a group for all amounts that are owed in connection with the Account. Each of you is responsible, even if the Account is used by only one of you. You will continue to be liable for the entire balance of the Account, even if your co-applicant or co-borrower is ordered by a court to pay us. You will remain liable to us if your co-applicant or co-borrower fails to pay as ordered by the court. Your Account status will continue to be reported to the credit bureau under each of your names.

505,47,"What claims (including initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, and third-party claims) are subject to arbitration: i. If either you or we make a demand for arbitration, you and we must arbitrate any dispute or claim between you or any other user of your account, and us, our affiliates, agents and/or dealers/merchants/retailers that accept the card or program sponsors if it relates to your account, except as noted in this section below. ii. We will not require you to arbitrate: any individual case in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, as long as it remains an individual case in that court. iii. Notwithstanding any other language in this section, only a court, not an arbitrator, will decide disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage 
or scope of this section or any part thereof (including, without limitation, the next paragraph of this section and/or this sentence). However, any 
dispute or argument that concerns the validity or enforceability of the Agreement as a whole is for the arbitrator, not a court, to decide."

If a court determines that this paragraph is not fully enforceable, only this sentence will remain in force and the remainder will be null and void, and the court’s determination shall be subject to appeal. This paragraph does not apply to any lawsuit or administrative proceeding filed against us by a state or federal government agency even when such agency is seeking relief on behalf of a class of borrowers, including you. This means that we will not have the right to compel arbitration of any claim brought by such an agency."
505,49,"How to start an arbitration, and the arbitration process i. The party who wants to arbitrate must notify the other party in writing. This notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit or in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to HC Processing Center, P.O. Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070, ATTN: ARBITRATION DEMAND. The party seeking arbitration must select an arbitration administrator, which can be either the American Arbitration Association (AAA), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org, (800) 778-7879, or JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com, (800) 352-5267. If neither administrator is able or willing to handle the dispute, then the court will appoint an arbitrator. ii. If a party files a lawsuit in court asserting claim(s) that are subject to arbitration and the other party files a motion with the court to compel arbitration, which is granted, it will be the responsibility of the party asserting the claim(s) to commence the arbitration proceeding. iii. The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and will tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least 10 years of legal experience. Once appointed, the arbitrator must apply the same law and legal principles, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), that would apply in court, but may use different procedural rules. If the administrator’s rules conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement will control. iv. The arbitration will take place by phone or at a reasonably convenient location. We will always pay arbitration costs, as well as your legal fees and costs, to the extent you prevail on claims you assert against us in an arbitration proceeding which you have commenced."
505,50,"Governing Law for Arbitration This Arbitration section of your Agreement is governed by the FAA. Utah law shall apply to the extent state law is relevant under the FAA. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award"

If you are the complaining party, you must send any claim notice to us at HC Processing Center, Legal Department, P.O. Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070. If we are the complaining party, we will send the claim notice to you at your address appearing in our records or, if you are represented by an attorney, to your attorney at his or her office address. If the complaining party and the defending party do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the claim notice is received, the complaining party may commence an arbitration subject to the terms of this Arbitration section of your Agreement. No settlement demand or settlement offer may be used in any proceeding as evidence or as an admission of any liability or damages."
505,52,"Special Payment If: (i) you submit a claim notice in an arbitration on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all the requirements of this Arbitration section of your Agreement; (ii) we refuse to provide you with the money damages you request; and (iii) the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the latest money damages you requested at least 10 days before the date the arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you the amount of the award or $7,500, whichever is greater, in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. We encourage you to include all claims you have in a single claim notice and/or a single arbitration. Accordingly, this $7,500 minimum award is a single award that applies to all claims you have asserted or could have asserted in the arbitration, and multiple awards of $7,500 are not contemplated under this Arbitration section of your Agreement."

506,10,"This Cardholder Agreement contains the general terms and conditions that will govern your credit card account (the “Account”), and the credit card we issue for Account access (the “Card”), if we approve your application for an Account. The Account application you signed or otherwise submitted to us (including its federal and state notices), and any written materials we may provide with your Card or as a supplement or amendment to this Cardholder Agreement, are part of and incorporated into this Cardholder Agreement by reference (together, our “Agreement” with you). In this Agreement, the words ""you"" and ""your"" mean each applicant (as an individual) and all applicants (as a group) shown on the Account application, and anyone else you authorize or permit to use your Account. The words ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our,"" mean First Electronic Bank, the financial institution that provides the Account and issues the Cards, and its assigns and successors. When the Agreement states that we “may” take an action, this means that we are allowed and have the sole discretion to take that action, subject only to any limitations or notices expressly required by law or this Agreement. You accept and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions in this Agreement, including its arbitration provision, the first time any of you use your Account. Oral agreements or commitments to loan money, extend credit or to forbear from enforcing repayment of a debt, including promises to extend or review such debt, are not enforceable. To protect you (borrower(s)) and us (creditor) from misunderstanding or disappointment, any agreements we reach covering such matters are contained in this writing, which is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between us, except as we may later agree in writing to modify it."
506,11,"USE OF CARD: Subject to the terms and conditions in the Agreement, you may use your Account to purchase goods and services from the merchants and providers (each, a “Participant”) that have agreed to participate in the credit card program we provide with assistance from Dent-AMed, Inc. d/b/a HC Processing Center. Before you attempt or agree to use the Account and Card to purchase any goods or services on credit from a Participant, you must notify the Participant that you intend to charge your purchase to your Card and obtain the Participant’s approval for the Card purchase. We will not extend Account credit to you for any purchase, unless you notified and obtained approval from a Participant for that purchase. We will not be liable to you if a participant or any merchant refuses to honor your Account and Card for any purchase. The Participant will prepare and submit a charge slip to us for Account purchases or submit an Account charge to us electronically for payment."
506,12,"ACCOUNT BILLING STATEMENTS AND NOTICES; ADDRESS ON FILE: If you have a credit or debit balance on the Account of $1 or more at the end of any billing period, we will send a periodic Account statement (a “bill”) showing what you owe us as of the end of that billing period. We may not send you a bill, however, if we have decided your Account is uncollectible, if we have sent the Account for collection proceedings against you, or if the law does not require or permit us to send the bill. The billing period is the fixed period of time covered by the bill we send you. Each bill that we send will identify the billing period that it covers. The bill will show your new charges, including interest and fees, and any payments that posted to your Account during that period. It will also show you the minimum payment you must make to us by the due date shown on the bill. You agree to examine each bill and notify us immediately of any item you may dispute. The billing error rights notice in this Agreement and on your bills provides more information about how you may notify us about any disputed items or billing errors. We will mail or deliver your bill only to one address. If your Account is a joint Account or more than one person is permitted to use the Account, you agree that we may send all Account bills and other Account notices solely to your address on file, as shown in our billing records. Your address on file is the address you provided in your Account application, unless: (a) we have received and processed a notice of a change in address that you provided in accordance with this Agreement or your most recent bill; or (b) we are notified by the U.S. Postal Service of an address correction for you and we decide, in good faith, to rely on the address correction notice we receive from the Postal Service. You agree to notify us immediately of any change in your mailing address, telephone numbers, or other contact information, such as your email addresses."
506,13,"BALANCE CATEGORIES: We put each charge on your Account, including interest and fees, into a balance category. We use the different balances to calculate the correct interest charges on your Account. If any type of charge is subject to a separate promotional interest rate, deferred interest, and/or reduced or deferred payment requirements (each, a “Promotional Balance”) we will put the Promotional Balance into a separate balance for the time period you qualify for the special promotional terms (“Promotional Terms”)."
506,14,"AUTHORIZED USERS AND AUTHORIZED CHARGES: If you give your Card or Account number to another person, he or she is an authorized user. An authorized charge is any charge you or any authorized user makes on the Account, and any fees and interest charges owing on the Account. Any charge made by an authorized user is an authorized charge. This is true even if you told the authorized user not to make that specific charge. A charge will still be authorized, even if it causes your Account to exceed its credit limit, is an illegal transaction, or is made after your Account is closed. An authorized charge can be made over the telephone, in person, on the Internet, or in any other way your Account can be used."
506,15,"Promise to Pay: You agree to pay all authorized charges on each bill, including interest and fees. You agree to pay us for any charges that we allow over your Account credit limit. You promise to pay at least the minimum payment by the due date shown on each bill."
506,16,"Payment Due Date; Payment Requirements: The due date is the date by which we must receive your payment for it to be on time. Your bill lists the due date, which will fall on the same calendar day of the month. Your due date will be at least 21 days from the date we send you the bill and at least 25 days from the end of the most recently ended billing period. To be on time, we must receive your payment on or before the due date at the place and by the time stated on your bill. Unless a bill states a different place for payments, your payments must be sent to: HC Processing Center, P.O. Box 268808, Oklahoma City, OK 73126 (regular mail); or HC Processing Center, 380 Data Drive, Suite 200, Draper, UT 84020 (overnight courier). Unless a bill states a different time, your payment is on time if we receive it by 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the due date. This 5:00 p.m. deadline is measured by the time zone in which we receive the payment, which may not be your time zone. If we do not receive or accept payments by mail on the due date, your payment will be on time if it is received by the next day that we accept or receive payments by mail. You must pay in U.S. dollars. You must not pay in cash. Your payment must be drawn on a U.S. deposit account or by a cashier’s check drawn on a U.S. bank or a foreign bank branch in the U.S. You must not attach or include any restrictive language to your payment. Any check or money order you send that has restrictive words, conditions, limitations, or special instructions to us, including those marked with words “paid in full” or similar language, must be mailed to: HC Processing Center, P.O. Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070. If you make payments in a paper form (such as check, money order, or cashier’s check), you must include the payment coupon from your bill or write your Account number on the payment. If we decide, in our discretion, to accept a form of payment that does not meet these payment instructions, you agree that we are not waiving our right to require you to make or continue making payments that comply with these instructions and are otherwise required by the Agreement. The credit available on your Account will be increased by the amount of your payment within 14 days after we receive your payment. You can also make a Payment or set up automatic payments by calling 1-877-486-3442. Automatic payments for the billing period shown on your statement will be deducted on the Payment Due Date shown on that statement, or the next automatic payment date referred to on your statement, unless you request a recurring payment date that occurs before your Payment Due Date. If your scheduled payment date falls on a Sunday or bank holiday, your payment will be processed the business day prior to the weekend or bank holiday. In order to schedule monthly payments by telephone, you will need this statement and your bank account information. You will be asked to provide the last four (4) digits of your social security number as your electronic signature. By providing those numbers, you will be agreeing to the authorization to allow us and your bank to deduct each authorized payment, in the amount selected by you, from your bank account. You also authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your bank account, as applicable, to correct an error in the processing of such payment. You can cancel a scheduled payment by phone at 1-877- 486-3442 or by mail at HC Processing Center, PO Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070; payment cancellations must be received before 5 PM CT of the scheduled withdrawal date."
506,17,"Minimum Payment: The bill we send to you will state your due date and the minimum amount you must pay by that due date (your “minimum payment” or the “minimum payment due” in this Agreement and on your bill). If you do not pay the minimum payment by its due date, we may charge you a late payment fee. You will also be in breach of this Agreement. You may pay all or part of your Account balance at any time. However, for each bill, you must pay at least the minimum payment by the due date stated on the bill. If any Promotional Terms apply that modify the payment requirements with respect to a Promotional Balance, then those Promotional Terms will explain how we determine the minimum payment due with respect to these Promotional Balances. As of the end of the billing period covered by the bill, we start by determining the amount that is the greater of: (i) the full unpaid balance of your Account, if this is less than $25.00; (ii) $25.00, if the balance is at least $25.00; (iii) 3.5% of the Highest Balance (excluding any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms make those Promotional Balances subject to different payment requirements). Then, we determine the minimum payment due for any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms modify the payment requirements for these Promotional Balances; or (iv) the sum of 1.0% of the Highest Balance (excluding any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms make those Promotional Balances subject to different payment requirements), plus all interest charges, late payment fees, and returned payment fees then due for the Account. Then, we determine whether there are any Account payments that are past due or balances that exceed the credit limit of your Account. Finally, we calculate your minimum payment due by adding together all the amounts described in this paragraph and rounding the result up to the nearest whole dollar. If you pay more than the minimum payment due after the end of any billing period, you must still pay at least the minimum payment due after the end of each billing period after that."
506,18,"Payment Allocation: We choose which Account balances to pay with your minimum payment. We generally apply payments above the minimum payment to balances with the highest APRs first, except that we may apply the part of your payment that exceeds the minimum payment first to any deferred interest balances during the last two billing periods of a deferred interest period."
506,19,"TYPES OF CHARGES: There are two types of charges or “Plans” under your Account: you may make a purchase on (a) the Regular Plan or (b) a Promotional Plan. The standard provisions of this Agreement apply to all Promotional Plan transactions unless otherwise specified prior to or at the time of purchase under a particular Promotional Plan offering, and will continue to apply to any and all transactions that are not subject to a Promotional Plan. The following Promotional Plan may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: Deferred Interest (a) Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, interest charges will be imposed from the purchase date. (b) Reduced Interest Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, reduced interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not made, the fully indexed APR will be imposed from the default date forward"
506,20,"APRs Applied to Different Balances: The “annual percentage rate” or “APR” is an annualized interest rate. We use the APR that applies to each balance to calculate the interest charges that you owe us on the Account. Different APRs may apply to different balances on your Account, such as purchases subject to the standard APR and any qualifying purchases we may allow you to make subject to deferred interest or a promotional APR."
506,21,"All your Account APRs are variable, unless we specifically state that a non-variable APR applies in connection with a deferred interest or promotional APR program. Variable APRs increase or decrease based on changes in the Prime Rate. For the Prime Rate, we use the U.S. Prime Rate that The Wall Street Journal publishes on the Friday that follows the last Thursday of each month (the “Determination Date”). If The Wall Street Journal no longer publishes a Prime Rate, we will use a similar published rate that we choose as a substitute. Any increase or decrease to a variable APR based on a change in the Prime Rate will apply to your Account balances and purchases as of the first day of the billing period that begins after a Determination Date. Any increase in an APR that applies to your Account may cause an increase to your minimum required monthly payment."
506,22,"Standard APR: We determine your standard APR by adding a margin of 24.49 percentage points to the Prime Rate. Currently, the standard APR of 29.99% applies to your account (corresponding to a Daily Periodic Rate of 0.082164%)."
506,23,"Use of Daily Balance Method with Compounding: We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the “daily periodic rate” for that balance to the “daily balance” of that balance. We do this for each day in the billing period and add together the resulting interest charges. That gives us the total interest charges for that balance for that billing period. You agree that we may round interest charges to the nearest cent. The “daily periodic rate” is a daily interest rate. The daily periodic rate for a given balance is equal to the APR for that balance divided by 365. We calculate the “daily balance” for each balance. We do this by starting with the beginning amount of that balance for each day. We add any new purchases and Account fees for that day, add any interest on the previous daily balance if there is one in that billing period, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the “daily balance.” The addition of the prior day’s interest to the daily balance calculation causes interest to compound daily. We add all Account fees and minimum interest charges to the daily balance of purchases subject to the standard APR. Any daily balance that is less than zero will be treated as zero. Each “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” shown on your bill will be an average of the daily balances during the billing period for that balance."
506,24,"When Interest Charges Begin; Grace Period: The “New Balance” of your Account is the full unpaid balance of your Account that is outstanding as of the end of each billing period covered by each bill. As long as you continue to pay the New Balance every month by the due date listed on your bill, there will be a grace period on your Account purchases and we will not charge interest on those purchases. If you do not pay by the due date the New Balance that is outstanding as of the end of a given billing period, there will be no grace period and you will owe interest on the unpaid Account balances from the end of that billing period. After the end of that billing period, all charges will accrue interest from the date they were made. To take advantage of the grace period again, you must pay your New Balance in full, make no new purchases, and pay on time for as much as two billing periods in a row"
506,25,Minimum Interest Charges: You must pay a minimum of $2.00 of interest after any billing period in which you owe any interest charges.
506,26,"Annual Fee: In the first billing period your Account has a purchase, we will charge a $59.00 annual fee to your Account. Thereafter you will be charged this annual fee on or about the anniversary of the first charge to your Account (your “Anniversary Date”), so long as your account has an unpaid balance or remains open for new purchases. We will notify you about this annual fee before each Anniversary Date. Our notice will explain when and how you may close your Account to future purchases and pay the full unpaid balance if you do not want to be charged this annual fee on an Anniversary Date."
506,27,"Returned Payment Fee: If your payment is returned unpaid to us for any reason, we will charge up to a $28.00 returned payment fee to your Account. If your payments are returned unpaid more than once during any six-month period, we will charge up to a $39.00 returned payment fee to your Account. After that, your returned payment fee will not return to $28.00 until you make Account payments required by the Agreement that are paid in full for six consecutive month"
506,28,"Late Payment Fee: If you do not pay at least the minimum payment due by its due date, we will charge a $28.00 late payment fee to your Account. If you do not pay the minimum payments due by their due dates more than once during any six-month period, we will charge a $39.00 late payment fee to your Account. After that, your late payment fee will not return to $28.00, until you make at least the minimum payment due by its due date for six consecutive months."
506,29,"Additional Account Fees: We will charge additional fees to your Account for certain services that you may request in connection with your Account. The additional fees we may charge to your Account for Account services include, but are not limited to, the following: a $10.00 per page fee for copies of documents unrelated to a billing error; a $5.00 fee to issue a replacement Card; a $9.95 expedited payment fee each time you request expedited assistance from our live customer service representative or agent to make an automated payment of your Account; and a $15.00 expedited service fee each time you request expedited assistance from us for reasons other than completing an Account payment (for example, to request an Account balance or payoff letter from us within three business days). You may contact us at 877-486-3442 at any time with questions about these and other Account services, or to request a schedule of other Account fees that we may require for particular services that are not listed here."
506,30,"CREDIT LIMIT: We will establish a credit limit for your Account. We may increase or decrease your Credit Line without notice. We may delay increasing your available credit by the amount of any payment that we receive for up to 14 days. You agree that you will not use or permit others to use your Account to obtain credit if it would cause the outstanding balance of your Account to exceed its credit limit. However, we may, at our option, without waiving any of our rights, permit charges to your Account, even if those charges would cause your outstanding Account balance to exceed its credit limit. We will not assess a fee if we elect to honor charges that cause your Account to exceed its credit limit."
506,31,"ENTIRE BALANCE DUE: If you break your promises under this Agreement, you understand and agree that we may demand that you pay the entire outstanding balance of your Account at once, subject to any legally required notices and limitations of applicable law. We may also do this if you made any false or misleading statements on your application, if you become insolvent or are subject to bankruptcy proceedings, or if you die, to the extent permitted by and in accordance with applicable law."
506,32,"COLLECTION COSTS: To the extent permitted by law, you promise to pay all the costs we incur to collect your Account, including reasonable and allowable attorney’s fees."

Each of you is responsible, even if the Account is used by only one of you.

You will remain liable to us if your co-applicant or co-borrower fails to pay as ordered by the court. Your Account status will continue to be reported to the credit bureau under each of your names.

The party seeking arbitration must select an arbitration administrator, which can be either the American Arbitration Association (AAA), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org, (800) 778-7879, or JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com, (800) 352-5267. If neither administrator is able or willing to handle the dispute, then the court will appoint an arbitrator. ii. If a party files a lawsuit in court asserting claim(s) that are subject to arbitration and the other party files a motion with the court to compel arbitration, which is granted, it will be the responsibility of the party asserting the claim(s) to commence the arbitration proceeding. iii. The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and will tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least 10 years of legal experience. Once appointed, the arbitrator must apply the same law and legal principles, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), that would apply in court, but may use different procedural rules. If the administrator’s rules conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement will control. iv. The arbitration will take place by phone or at a reasonably convenient location. We will always pay arbitration costs, as well as your legal fees and costs, to the extent you prevail on claims you assert against us in an arbitration proceeding which you have commenced."
506,50,"Governing Law for Arbitration This Arbitration section of your Agreement is governed by the FAA. Utah law shall apply to the extent state law is relevant under the FAA. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award."
506,51,". Pre-Dispute Resolution Procedure Before you or we bring any dispute or claim, the complaining party shall give the defending party: (i) a claim notice providing at least 30 days’ written notice of the claim and explaining in reasonable detail the nature of the claim and any supporting facts; and (ii) a reasonable, good-faith opportunity to resolve the claim on an individual basis without the necessity of any proceeding. If you are the complaining party, you must send any claim notice to us at HC Processing Center, Legal Department, P.O. Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070. If we are the complaining party, we will send the claim notice to you at your address appearing in our records or, if you are represented by an attorney, to your attorney at his or her office address. If the complaining party and the defending party do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the claim notice is received, the complaining party may commence an arbitration subject to the terms of this Arbitration section of your Agreement. No settlement demand or settlement offer may be used in any proceeding as evidence or as an admission of any liability or damages."
506,52,"Special Payment If: (i) you submit a claim notice in an arbitration on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) and comply with all the requirements of this Arbitration section of your Agreement; (ii) we refuse to provide you with the money damages you request; and (iii) the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the latest money damages you requested at least 10 days before the date the arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you the amount of the award or $7,500, whichever is greater, in addition to the attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) to which you are otherwise entitled. We encourage you to include all claims you have in a single claim notice and/or a single arbitration. Accordingly, this $7,500 minimum award is a single award that applies to all claims you have asserted or could have asserted in the arbitration, and multiple awards of $7,500 are not contemplated under this Arbitration section of your Agreement."

In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.

You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question."
506,56,"What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: 1. If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. 2. If we do not believe there was a mistake: You must pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct."

To use this right, all the following must be true: 1. The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the purchase. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase. If all the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at: HC Processing Center, P.O. Box 708970, Sandy, UT 84070. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision.

The Account application you signed or otherwise submitted to us (including its federal and state notices), and any written materials we may provide with your Card or as a supplement or amendment to this Cardholder Agreement, are part of and incorporated into this Cardholder Agreement by reference (together, our “Agreement” with you). In this Agreement, the words ""you"" and ""your"" mean each applicant (as an individual) and all applicants (as a group) shown on the Account application, and anyone else you authorize or permit to use your Account. The words ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our,"" mean First Electronic Bank, the financial institution that provides the Account and issues the Cards, and its assigns and successors.

We will not be liable to you if a participant or any merchant refuses to honor your Account and Card for any purchase. The Participant will prepare and submit a charge slip to us for Account purchases or submit an Account charge to us electronically for payment."
507,12,"ACCOUNT BILLING STATEMENTS AND NOTICES; ADDRESS ON FILE: If you have a credit or debit balance on the Account of $1 or more at the end of any billing period, we will send a periodic Account statement (a “bill”) showing what you owe us as of the end of that billing period. We may not send you a bill, however, if we have decided your Account is uncollectible, if we have sent the Account for collection proceedings against you, or if the law does not require or permit us to send the bill. The billing period is the fixed period of time covered by the bill we send you. Each bill that we send will identify the billing period that it covers. The bill will show your new charges, including interest and fees, and any payments that posted to your Account during that period. It will also show you the minimum payment you must make to us by the due date shown on the bill. You agree to examine each bill and notify us immediately of any item you may dispute. The billing error rights notice in this Agreement and on your bills provides more information about how you may notify us about any disputed items or billing errors. We will mail or deliver your bill only to one address. If your Account is a joint Account or more than one person is permitted to use the Account, you agree that we may send all Account bills and other Account notices solely to your address on file, as shown in our billing records. Your address on file is the address you provided in your Account application, unless: (a) we have received and processed a notice of a change in address that you provided in accordance with this Agreement or your most recent bill; or (b) we are notified by the U.S. Postal Service of an address correction for you and we decide, in good faith, to rely on the address correction notice we receive from the Postal Service. You agree to notify us immediately of any change in your mailing address, telephone numbers, or other contact information, such as your email addresses"
507,13,"BALANCE CATEGORIES: We put each charge on your Account, including interest and fees, into a balance category. We use the different balances to calculate the correct interest charges on your Account. If any type of charge is subject to a separate promotional interest rate, deferred interest, and/or reduced or deferred payment requirements (each, a “Promotional Balance”) we will put the Promotional Balance into a separate balance for the time period you qualify for the special promotional terms (“Promotional Terms”)."
507,14,"AUTHORIZED USERS AND AUTHORIZED CHARGES: If you give your Card or Account number to another person, he or she is an authorized user. An authorized charge is any charge you or any authorized user makes on the Account, and any fees and interest charges owing on the Account. Any charge made by an authorized user is an authorized charge. This is true even if you told the authorized user not to make that specific charge. A charge will still be authorized, even if it causes your Account to exceed its credit limit, is an illegal transaction, or is made after your Account is closed. An authorized charge can be made over the telephone, in person, on the Internet, or in any other way your Account can be used."
507,15,"Promise to Pay: You agree to pay all authorized charges on each bill, including interest and fees. You agree to pay us for any charges that we allow over your Account credit limit. You promise to pay at least the minimum payment by the due date shown on each bill."
507,16,"B. Payment Due Date; Payment Requirements: The due date is the date by which we must receive your payment for it to be on time. Your bill lists the due date, which will fall on the same calendar day of the month. Your due date will be at least 21 days from the date we send you the bill and at least 25 days from the end of the most recently ended billing period. To be on time, we must receive your payment on or before the due date at the place and by the time stated on your bill. Unless a bill states a different place for payments, your payments must be sent to: HC Processing Center, P.O. Box 268808, Oklahoma City, OK 73126 (regular mail); or HC Processing Center, 380 Data Drive, Suite 200, Draper, UT 84020 (overnight courier). Unless a bill states a different time, your payment is on time if we receive it by 5:00 p.m. Central Time on the due date. This 5:00 p.m. deadline is measured by the time zone in which we receive the payment, which may not be your time zone. If we do not receive or accept payments by mail on the due date, your payment will be on time if it is received by the next day that we accept or receive payments by mail. You must pay in U.S. dollars. You must not pay in cash. Your payment must be drawn on a U.S. deposit account or by a cashier’s check drawn on a U.S. bank or a foreign bank branch in the U.S. You must not attach or include any restrictive language to your payment. Any check or money order you send that has restrictive words, conditions, limitations, or special instructions to us, including those marked with words “paid in full” or similar language, must be mailed to: HC Processing Center, P.O. Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070. If you make payments in a paper form (such as check, money order, or cashier’s check), you must include the payment coupon from your bill or write your Account number on the payment. If we decide, in our discretion, to accept a form of payment that does not meet these payment instructions, you agree that we are not waiving our right to require you to make or continue making payments that comply with these instructions and are otherwise required by the Agreement. The credit available on your Account will be increased by the amount of your payment within 14 days after we receive your payment. You can also make a Payment or set up automatic payments by calling 1-877-486-3442. Automatic payments for the billing period shown on your statement will be deducted on the Payment Due Date shown on that statement, or the next automatic payment date referred to on your statement, unless you request a recurring payment date that occurs before your Payment Due Date. If your scheduled payment date falls on a Sunday or bank holiday, your payment will be processed the business day prior to the weekend or bank holiday. In order to schedule monthly payments by telephone, you will need this statement and your bank account information. You will be asked to provide the last four (4) digits of your social security number as your electronic signature. By providing those numbers, you will be agreeing to the authorization to allow us and your bank to deduct each authorized payment, in the amount selected by you, from your bank account. You also authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your bank account, as applicable, to correct an error in the processing of such payment. You can cancel a scheduled payment by phone at 1-877- 486-3442 or by mail at HC Processing Center, PO Box 708670, Sandy, UT 84070; payment cancellations must be received before 5 PM CT of the scheduled withdrawal date."
507,17,"Minimum Payment: The bill we send to you will state your due date and the minimum amount you must pay by that due date (your “minimum payment” or the “minimum payment due” in this Agreement and on your bill). If you do not pay the minimum payment by its due date, we may charge you a late payment fee. You will also be in breach of this Agreement. You may pay all or part of your Account balance at any time. However, for each bill, you must pay at least the minimum payment by the due date stated on the bill. If any Promotional Terms apply that modify the payment requirements with respect to a Promotional Balance, then those Promotional Terms will explain how we determine the minimum payment due with respect to these Promotional Balances. As of the end of the billing period covered by the bill, we start by determining the amount that is the greater of: (i) the full unpaid balance of your Account, if this is less than $25.00; (ii) $25.00, if the balance is at least $25.00; (iii) 4.0% of the Highest Balance (excluding any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms make those Promotional Balances subject to different payment requirements). Then, we determine the minimum payment due for any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms modify the payment requirements for these Promotional Balances; or (iv) the sum of 1.0% of the Highest Balance (excluding any Promotional Balances whose Promotional Terms make those Promotional Balances subject to different payment requirements), plus all interest charges, late payment fees, and returned payment fees then due for the Account. Then, we determine whether there are any Account payments that are past due or balances that exceed the credit limit of your Account. Finally, we calculate your minimum payment due by adding together all the amounts described in this paragraph and rounding the result up to the nearest whole dollar. If you pay more than the minimum payment due after the end of any billing period, you must still pay at least the minimum payment due after the end of each billing period after that."
507,18,"Payment Allocation: We choose which Account balances to pay with your minimum payment. We generally apply payments above the minimum payment to balances with the highest APRs first, except that we may apply the part of your payment that exceeds the minimum payment first to any deferred interest balances during the last two billing periods of a deferred interest period."
507,19,"TYPES OF CHARGES: There are two types of charges or “Plans” under your Account: you may make a purchase on (a) the Regular Plan or (b) a Promotional Plan. The standard provisions of this Agreement apply to all Promotional Plan transactions unless otherwise specified prior to or at the time of purchase under a particular Promotional Plan offering, and will continue to apply to any and all transactions that are not subject to a Promotional Plan. The following Promotional Plan may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: Deferred Interest (a) Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, interest charges will be imposed from the purchase date. (b) Reduced Interest Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, reduced interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not made, the fully indexed APR will be imposed from the default date forward."
507,20,"APRs Applied to Different Balances: The “annual percentage rate” or “APR” is an annualized interest rate. We use the APR that applies to each balance to calculate the interest charges that you owe us on the Account. Different APRs may apply to different balances on your Account, such as purchases subject to the standard APR and any qualifying purchases we may allow you to make subject to deferred interest or a promotional APR"
507,21,"Variable APRs: None of your Account APRs are variable, unless we specifically state that a variable APR applies in connection with a deferred interest or promotional APR program. Variable APRs increase or decrease based on changes in the Prime Rate. For the Prime Rate, we use the U.S. Prime Rate that The Wall Street Journal publishes on the Friday that follows the last Thursday of each month (the “Determination Date”). If The Wall Street Journal no longer publishes a Prime Rate, we will use a similar published rate that we choose as a substitute. Any increase or decrease to a variable APR based on a change in the Prime Rate will apply to your Account balances and purchases as of the first day of the billing period that begins after a Determination Date. Any increase in an APR that applies to your Account may cause an increase to your minimum required monthly payment."
507,22,"Standard APR: Currently, the standard APR of 35.99% applies to your Account (corresponding to a Daily Periodic Rate of 0.098603%"
507,23,"Use of Daily Balance Method with Compounding: We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the “daily periodic rate” for that balance to the “daily balance” of that balance. We do this for each day in the billing period and add together the resulting interest charges. That gives us the total interest charges for that balance for that billing period. You agree that we may round interest charges to the nearest cent. The “daily periodic rate” is a daily interest rate. The daily periodic rate for a given balance is equal to the APR for that balance divided by 365. We calculate the “daily balance” for each balance. We do this by starting with the beginning amount of that balance for each day. We add any new purchases and Account fees for that day, add any interest on the previous daily balance if there is one in that billing period, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the “daily balance.” The addition of the prior day’s interest to the daily balance calculation causes interest to compound daily. We add all Account fees and minimum interest charges to the daily balance of purchases subject to the standard APR. Any daily balance that is less than zero will be treated as zero. Each “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” shown on your bill will be an average of the daily balances during the billing period for that balance."
507,24,"When Interest Charges Begin; Grace Period: The “New Balance” of your Account is the full unpaid balance of your Account that is outstanding as of the end of each billing period covered by each bill. As long as you continue to pay the New Balance every month by the due date listed on your bill, there will be a grace period on your Account purchases and we will not charge interest on those purchases. If you do not pay by the due date the New Balance that is outstanding as of the end of a given billing period, there will be no grace period and you will owe interest on the unpaid Account balances from the end of that billing period. After the end of that billing period, all charges will accrue interest from the date they were made. To take advantage of the grace period again, you must pay your New Balance in full, make no new purchases, and pay on time for as much as two billing periods in a row"
507,25,Minimum Interest Charges: You must pay a minimum of $2.00 of interest after any billing period in which you owe any interest charges
507,26,"Annual Fee: In the first billing period your Account has a purchase, we will charge a $59.00 annual fee to your Account. Thereafter you will be charged this annual fee on or about the anniversary of the first charge to your Account (your “Anniversary Date”), so long as your account has an unpaid balance or remains open for new purchases. We will notify you about this annual fee before each Anniversary Date. Our notice will explain when and how you may close your Account to future purchases and pay the full unpaid balance if you do not want to be charged this annual fee on an Anniversary Date"
507,27,"Returned Payment Fee: If your payment is returned unpaid to us for any reason, we will charge up to a $28.00 returned payment fee to your Account. If your payments are returned unpaid more than once during any six-month period, we will charge up to a $39.00 returned payment fee to your Account. After that, your returned payment fee will not return to $28.00 until you make Account payments required by the Agreement that are paid in full for six consecutive months."
507,28,". Late Payment Fee: If you do not pay at least the minimum payment due by its due date, we will charge a $28.00 late payment fee to your Account. If you do not pay the minimum payments due by their due dates more than once during any six-month period, we will charge a $39.00 late payment fee to your Account. After that, your late payment fee will not return to $28.00, until you make at least the minimum payment due by its due date for six consecutive months."
507,29,"Additional Account Fees: We will charge additional fees to your Account for certain services that you may request in connection with your Account. The additional fees we may charge to your Account for Account services include, but are not limited to, the following: a $10.00 per page fee for copies of documents unrelated to a billing error; a $5.00 fee to issue a replacement Card; a $9.95 expedited payment fee each time you request expedited assistance from our live customer service representative or agent to make an automated payment of your Account; and a $15.00 expedited service fee each time you request expedited assistance from us for reasons other than completing an Account payment (for example, to request an Account balance or payoff letter from us within three business days).

However, we may, at our option, without waiving any of our rights, permit charges to your Account, even if those charges would cause your outstanding Account balance to exceed its credit limit. We will not assess a fee if we elect to honor charges that cause your Account to exceed its credit limit"

The arbitration administrator will appoint the arbitrator and will tell the parties what to do next. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least 10 years of legal experience. Once appointed, the arbitrator must apply the same law and legal principles, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), that would apply in court, but may use different procedural rules. If the administrator’s rules conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement will control. iv. The arbitration will take place by phone or at a reasonably convenient location.

Thereafter, your credit limit and available credit on your Account will be disclosed on each monthly billing statement. You agree not to exceed your credit limit unless authorized by us.

If an Invoice shows that a specific plan applies, then the purchase will be governed by the terms on the Invoice and the terms of this Agreement. You accept the special terms by making the purchase. The Invoice will state the length of the special terms period, if any."
508,18,"TYPES OF CHARGES. There are two types of charges or “Plans” under your Account: you may make a purchase on (a) the Regular Plan or (b) a Promotional Plan. The standard provisions of this Agreement apply to all Promotional Plan transactions unless otherwise specified prior to or at the time of purchase under a particular Promotional Plan offering, and will continue to apply to any and all transactions that are not subject to a Promotional Plan. The following Promotional Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: (a) Same As Cash Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, interest charges will be imposed from the purchase date. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Plan are referred to as Regular Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Account. Call 1-855-457- 0419 for information."
508,19,"MONTHLY BILLING STATEMENT. We will send you a monthly billing statement summarizing each transaction on your Account during the preceding billing period. The billing statement will also show the total amount that you owe the Bank at the end of the current billing period, including any interest charges, fees, debt cancellation (if applicable), the minimum payment due, the payment due date (which date is at least 24 days from the monthly statement closing date), and a summary regarding any Promotional Plan charges and due dates. It also shows your current Credit Limit. We will mail or deliver your billing statement to only one address. If your Account is a joint Account or if more than one person is permitted to use the Account, you agree that all billing statements and notices regarding the Account may be sent solely to the address shown on our billing records. Please review each billing statement carefully. You must notify us promptly of any change in your name, residence or billing address by writing to us at the “Mail Inquiries” address on your billing statement. Preservation of your rights under federal law regarding resolution of billing errors depends upon your timely recognition of potential errors, as explained in paragraph 36 below. If you default under this Agreement, we may, in our sole discretion, stop sending you billing statements if we deem your Account uncollectible or if we institute delinquency collection proceedings."
508,20,"VARIABLE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). The interest rate on your account is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the first day of the month that The Wall Street Journal is published (the “Index”). If the index becomes unavailable, the Bank may designate a substitute Index after providing notice to you. The Standard APR will increase when the Prime Rate increases. If the Prime Rate changes, resulting in a change in the APR, the change will take effect on the first day of your next billing period. Each time the APR changes, we will apply it to any existing balances, subject to special terms of any applicable Promotional Plans. An increase in the variable APR means you will pay higher interest charges and perhaps a higher minimum payment."
508,21,ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES. The APR for purchases is based on a monthly “Prime Rate” plus a margin. The Standard APR is determined by adding 23.74% to the Prime Rate. The corresponding daily periodic rates are 1/365th (1/366th for a leap year) of the then current APR. The applicable APRs at the time of account opening are displayed in the Current Rate Schedule immediately preceding this Agreement. Subsequent applicable APRs will appear in the monthly billing statement. The APRS may change. Please see paragraph 11 for details relating to how these rates may change.
508,22,"MILITARY LENDING ACT DISCLOSURES. Notice for active duty military personnel and dependents: Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: The costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts); and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account). If you would like to hear about your Military Lending Act rights and a description of your payment obligation, please contact us at 1-877-634-6368"
508,23,"INTEREST CHARGES. The following interest charges apply whether before or after default, judgment, or the closing of your Account: (a) When Periodic Interest Charges Begin To Accrue. Your due date is at least 24 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month, otherwise, periodic interest charges will be assessed on each purchase from the date of the transaction. If during the previous billing cycle you paid in full by the Payment Due Date, then in the current billing cycle you will have an additional interest-free period on the amount of any Regular Plan Purchases paid by the Payment Due Date, based on our payment allocation method. Under certain Promotional Plans that may be offered from time to time, interest charges may be waived under the specific terms that will be provided at or prior to the time of purchase under such Promotional Plan. (b) Calculation of Interest Charges. The total amount of interest charges for a billing period will be calculated as follows: (1) Regular Plan - We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance of your account (including new transactions). To get the Average Daily Balance we take the beginning balance of your Regular Plan account each day, add any new purchases and fees and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance (any unpaid interest charges incurred during that billing period are not included in the daily balance). Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance,” which is also called the “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” on your monthly statement. We then multiply the Average Daily Balance by the daily periodic rate (DPR). That number is then multiplied by the number of days in the billing period. (2) Promotional Plans - We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to each Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance. These are special promotional transaction balances on which interest charges are accruing but will be waived provided (i) the balance for the Promotional Plan is paid in full by the Promotion Expiration Date as specified on the front of your billing statement, and (ii) you do not default, by failing to make any Minimum Payment Due by 60 days from the due date shown on your billing statement, before the Promotional Plan has been paid in full. Promotional Plans with different promotional expiration dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. To get the Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance, we take the beginning balance of each Promotional Plan account each day and subtract any payments or credits applicable to that Plan. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us each Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance, which is also called the “Deferred Interest Balance” on your monthly statement. We then multiply the Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance by the daily periodic rate (DPR). That number is then multiplied by the number of days in the billing period. (3) The sum of the amounts determined under (1) and (2) above is your interest charge on purchases. The deferred interest charge, if any, determined under (2) above is accumulated from billing cycle to billing cycle and posted to your Account as interest charges only if the applicable Promotional Plan has not been paid in full by the Promotion Expiration Date or if you default, by failing to make any Minimum Payment Due by 60 days from the due date shown on your billing statement, before the Promotional Plan transactions have been paid in full. (c) Days in Billing Period. For interest charge calculation purposes, the billing period begins on the day after the Statement/Closing Date of the previous billing period and includes the Statement/Closing Date of the current billing period. The number of days in the billing period may vary. (d) Minimum Interest Fee. A minimum interest charge of $2.00 will be assessed on each Account for any billing cycle in which an interest charge is due"
508,24,". MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE. You agree to pay us, in time for receipt by us on or before the applicable due date and time shown on your billing statement and this Agreement, the total “minimum due” amount reflected on your billing statement. The total minimum payment due will be equal to the greater of $35.00 ($2.00 if there is no Regular Plan balance or if the Regular Plan balance is less than $35.00) or 1% of balance plus billed interest charges plus any fees plus any Past Due amount, rounded up to the next whole dollar. If the balance shown on your statement is less than $35.00, your Minimum Payment Due will be the entire balance. Your receipt of a credit does not relieve you of your obligation to pay the Minimum Payment Due. You may at any time pay more than the minimum payment due without penalty. However, when you pay more than your minimum payment due it will not extend, delay or otherwise impact your payment due in the following billing period. Making only the minimum payment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance."
508,25,"PAYMENTS. The payment due date on your Account will be the same date each month and will be at least 24 days from the closing date on your statement. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars drawn on funds on deposit in the United States. You may, at any time, pay more than the monthly Minimum Payment Due or even the entire outstanding balance without a penalty. No partial prepayment will extend the due date of any succeeding payment. Payments on your Account should be mailed to us at our remittance address shown on your billing statement. Payments accompanied by the payment coupon portion of your billing statement received by us at that address before 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on any banking day will be credited to your Account as of that day. Payments received by us at any other location, or in any other form, may be subject to a delay in crediting of up to 5 days after receipt. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) missing a signature; (b) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (c) restrictively endorsed; (d) postdated; or, (e) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to the “Mail Payments” address on your billing statement. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance. Your Available Credit may be increased by the amount of your payment within a reasonable time after that payment is received. If you have multiple plan balances, payments in the amount of the minimum payment will be allocated to the total Minimum Payment Due. Any payment amount above the minimum payment due will be applied as follows: (1) If you have a deferred interest promotion plan balance in the last two cycles prior to expiration, excess payments will be applied to that balance first, and (2) In all other situations, we will apply excess payments to your higher interest balances."
508,26,"ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. Your check will not be returned to you by us or your bank."
508,27,"OTHER CHARGES. Other charges on your Account include the following: (a) Late Payment Fee. We may add the following fees to your purchase balance if we do not receive your minimum monthly payment by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the payment due date shown on your billing statement. The Late Payment Fee will be up to $25. If you are late more than once in a six month period, the late payment fee will go up to $35. If you make on time payments for six months, it will return to $25. (For Iowa Residents the late payment fee will be up to $15)."
508,28,"Returned Payment Fee. We may add a fee of up to $25 (up to $20 Iowa Residents) to your purchase balance when a check or other payment on your Account is not honored, when we must return it because it cannot be processed, or when an automatic debit is returned unpaid. At our option, we may assess this fee the first time your check or payment is not honored, even if it is honored upon resubmission."

We may permit you to make a payment on your Account by authorizing us over the telephone to transfer or pay funds from your deposit account to your Fry’s Credit Account.

508,34,Paper Statement Fee. We may add a fee of $1 if we mail a paper billing statement to you

After your default or your death, and subject to the limitations of applicable law, we may at our option: (a) close your Account and declare the entire unpaid balance on your Account immediately due and payable, (b) require you to surrender the products purchased with any outstanding loans from your Account, and (c) exercise all other rights and remedies available to us under applicable law. In the event of your default, and subject to any limitations or requirements of applicable law, you agree to pay all costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by us (a) in collecting all amounts due on your Account, whether or not suit is brought against you, and (b) in protecting ourselves from any harm that we may suffer as a result of your default."

508,47,"ARBITRATION PROVISION. This Arbitration Provision does not apply to you if, as of the date of this Agreement, you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such member entitled to protection under the Federal Military Lending Act. Unless you exercise your right to reject arbitration under subsection (n) below, the following Arbitration Provision will apply: (a) General: Either you or we may elect to arbitrate or require the other party to arbitrate any Claim (as defined below) under the following terms and conditions. If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (i) have a court or a jury decide the Claim; (ii) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or a class member; (iii) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (iv) join or consolidate your Claim(s) with claims of any other person. The right to appeal and the right to discovery are more limited in arbitration than in court. Other rights that you would have if you went to court may also not be available in arbitration. (b) Definitions: The following definitions apply to this Arbitration Provision, even if terms defined in this Arbitration Provision are defined differently elsewhere in this Agreement: (i) “We,” “us” and “our” mean First Electronic Bank or any subsequent holder of this Agreement. Also, these terms include the parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and successors of such company, as well as the officers, directors, agents and employees of any of the foregoing. These terms also include any party named as a co-defendant with us in a Claim asserted by you, such as marketing companies, credit bureaus, credit insurance companies, credit card or loan servicers and debt collectors. “You,” “your” and “yours” include each and every Cardholder or Authorized User. (ii) “Administrator” means the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org, 800-778-7879; JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com, 800-352-5267; or any other company selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If both AAA and JAMS cannot or will not serve and the parties are unable to select an Administrator by mutual consent, the Administrator will be selected by a court. The party initiating an arbitration selects the Administrator. Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, no arbitration may be administered, without the consent of all parties to the arbitration, by any Administrator that has in place a formal or informal policy that would purport to override subsection (d) below, captioned “No Class Actions” (the “Class Action Waiver”). (iii) “Claim” means any claim, dispute or controversy between you and us that in any way arises from or relates to this Agreement or the Account, including disputes arising from actions or omissions prior to the date of this Agreement. “Claim” has the broadest reasonable meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims. It includes disputes based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other intentional torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief). However, it does not include disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof (including, without limitation, the Class Action Waiver, the final sentence in subsection (j) under the caption “Survival, Severability, Primacy” and/or this sentence); all such disputes are for a court and not an arbitrator to decide. However, any dispute or argument that concerns the validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a whole is for the arbitrator, not a court, to decide. Claim does not include: (1) any individual action brought by you or us in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, unless such action is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court; (2) the exercising of any self-help rights by you or us or (3) any individual action in court by one party that is limited to preventing the other party from using a self-help remedy and that does not involve a request for damages or monetary relief of any kind. The institution and/or maintenance of any such right, action or litigation will not constitute a waiver of the right of either of the parties to compel arbitration regarding any other dispute subject to arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision. (c) Starting or Demanding Arbitration: To start an arbitration, the party asserting the Claim (the “Claimant”) must commence the arbitration in accordance with the Administrator's rules. To require arbitration of a Claim, the party defending the Claim (the “Defending Party”) must give the Claimant a written demand for arbitration. This demand may be given after a lawsuit has been filed and may be given in papers or motions in the lawsuit. If an arbitration is commenced or an arbitration demand is given, the Claim shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Provision and the applicable rules of the Administrator then in effect. (d) No Class Actions: Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, if you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (i) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative, class member or otherwise; (ii) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (iii) join or consolidate Claims by or against you with claims by or against any other person, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to conduct any such class, private attorney general or multiple-party proceeding. (e) Location and Costs: Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient for you. If you cannot obtain a waiver of the Administrator's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, we will consider in good faith any request by you for us to bear such fees. We will pay for our own attorneys, experts and witnesses and will pay the reasonable fees and charges of your attorneys, experts and witnesses if and to the extent you prevail in the arbitration. Even if you do not win the arbitration, we will pay any of the Administrator's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, and the fees and charges of your attorneys, experts and witnesses, if and to the extent we are required to pay such fees and charges by law or the Administrator’s rules or in order to make this Arbitration Provision enforceable. (f) Arbitrator Selection: The arbitrator will be appointed by the Administrator in accordance with the rules of the Administrator. However, unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator must be a retired or former judge or a lawyer with at least 10 years of experience. (g) Discovery; Getting Information: In addition to the parties' rights under the Administrator's rules to obtain information prior to the hearing, either party may ask the arbitrator for more information from the other party. The arbitrator will decide the issue in his or her sole discretion, after allowing the other party the opportunity to object. (h) Effect of Arbitration Award: Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for: (1) any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. (the “FAA”); and (2) Claims involving more than $50,000. If permitted by the Administrator’s rules, for Claims involving more than $50,000, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider anew any aspect of the initial award that is appealed.

509,19,"TYPES OF CHARGES. There are two types of charges or “Plans” under your Account: you may make a purchase on (a) the Regular Plan or (b) a Promotional Plan.

The following Promotional Plans may be offered from time to time as specified prior to or at the time of purchase: (a) Same As Cash Monthly Payment Plan – If you pay the full cash sales price of the purchase by the promotional due date, as indicated on your billing statement, and pay the Minimum Payment Due when due each billing cycle, as indicated on your billing statement, no interest charges will be imposed on the purchase. If such payments are not so made, interest charges will be imposed from the purchase date. All purchases that do not fall under a Promotional Plan are referred to as Regular Plan purchases. Certain rules apply to the allocation of payments and interest charges on your promotional purchase if you make more than one purchase on your Account. Call 1-855-457- 0419 for information."
509,20,". MONTHLY BILLING STATEMENT. We will send you a monthly billing statement summarizing each transaction on your Account during 
the preceding billing period. The billing statement will also show the total amount that you owe the Bank at the end of the current billing 
period, including any interest charges, fees, debt cancellation (if applicable), the minimum payment due, the payment due date (which date 
is at least 24 days from the monthly statement closing date), and a summary regarding any Promotional Plan charges and due dates. It also 
shows your current Credit Limit. We will mail or deliver your billing statement to only one address. If your Account is a joint Account or if 
more than one person is permitted to use the Account, you agree that all billing statements and notices regarding the Account may be sent 
solely to the address shown on our billing records. 
Please review each billing statement carefully. You must notify us promptly of any change in your name, residence or billing address by 
writing to us at the “Mail Inquiries” address on your billing statement. Preservation of your rights under federal law regarding resolution of 
billing errors depends upon your timely recognition of potential errors, as explained in paragraph 36 below. If you default under this 
Agreement, we may, in our sole discretion, stop sending you billing statements if we deem your Account uncollectible or if we institute 
delinquency collection proceedings."
509,21,". VARIABLE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR). The interest rate on your account is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the first day of the month that The Wall Street Journal is published (the “Index”). If the index becomes unavailable, the Bank may designate a substitute Index after providing notice to you. The Standard APR will increase when the Prime Rate increases. If the Prime Rate changes, resulting in a change in the APR, the change will take effect on the first day of your next billing period. Each time the APR changes, we will apply it to any existing balances, subject to special terms of any applicable Promotional Plans. An increase in the variable APR means you will pay higher interest charges and perhaps a higher minimum payment."
509,22,. ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATES. The APR for purchases is based on a monthly “Prime Rate” plus a margin. The Standard APR is determined by adding 23.74% to the Prime Rate. The corresponding daily periodic rates are 1/365th (1/366th for a leap year) of the then current APR. The applicable APRs at the time of account opening are displayed in the Current Rate Schedule immediately preceding this Agreement. Subsequent applicable APRs will appear in the monthly billing statement. The APRS may change. Please see paragraph 11 for details relating to how these rates may change.

509,24,". INTEREST CHARGES. The following interest charges apply whether before or after default, judgment, or the closing of your Account: (a) When Periodic Interest Charges Begin To Accrue. Your due date is at least 24 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you any interest on purchases if you pay your entire balance by the due date each month, otherwise, periodic interest charges will be assessed on each purchase from the date of the transaction. If during the previous billing cycle you paid in full by the Payment Due Date, then in the current billing cycle you will have an additional interest-free period on the amount of any Regular Plan Purchases paid by the Payment Due Date, based on our payment allocation method. Under certain Promotional Plans that may be offered from time to time, interest charges may be waived under the specific terms that will be provided at or prior to the time of purchase under such Promotional Plan."
509,25,"(b) Calculation of Interest Charges. The total amount of interest charges for a billing period will be calculated as follows: (1) Regular Plan - We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance of your account (including new transactions). To get the Average Daily Balance we take the beginning balance of your Regular Plan account each day, add any new purchases and fees and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance (any unpaid interest charges incurred during that billing period are not included in the daily balance). Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “Average Daily Balance,” which is also called the “Balance Subject to Interest Rate” on your monthly statement. We then multiply the Average Daily Balance by the daily periodic rate (DPR). That number is then multiplied by the number of days in the billing period. (2) Promotional Plans - We calculate the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to each Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance. These are special promotional transaction balances on which interest charges are accruing but will be waived provided (i) the balance for the Promotional Plan is paid in full by the Promotion Expiration Date as specified on the front of your billing statement, and (ii) you do not default, by failing to make any Minimum Payment Due by 60 days from the due date shown on your billing statement, before the Promotional Plan has been paid in full. Promotional Plans with different promotional expiration dates or terms are treated as different Credit Plans for this purpose. To get the Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance, we take the beginning balance of each Promotional Plan account each day and subtract any payments or credits applicable to that Plan. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us each Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance, which is also called the “Deferred Interest Balance” on your monthly statement. We then multiply the Promotional Plan Average Daily Balance by the daily periodic rate (DPR). That number is then multiplied by the number of days in the billing period. (3) The sum of the amounts determined under (1) and (2) above is your interest charge on purchases. The deferred interest charge, if any, determined under (2) above is accumulated from billing cycle to billing cycle and posted to your Account as interest charges only if the applicable Promotional Plan has not been paid in full by the Promotion Expiration Date or if you default, by failing to make any Minimum Payment Due by 60 days from the due date shown on your billing statement, before the Promotional Plan transactions have been paid in full."
509,26,"(c) Days in Billing Period. For interest charge calculation purposes, the billing period begins on the day after the Statement/Closing Date of the previous billing period and includes the Statement/Closing Date of the current billing period. The number of days in the billing period may vary."
509,27,(d) Minimum Interest Fee. A minimum interest charge of $2.00 will be assessed on each Account for any billing cycle in which an interest charge is due.
509,28,"MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE. You agree to pay us, in time for receipt by us on or before the applicable due date and time shown on your billing statement and this Agreement, the total “minimum due” amount reflected on your billing statement. The total minimum payment due will be equal to the greater of $35.00 ($2.00 if there is no Regular Plan balance or if the Regular Plan balance is less than $35.00) or 1% of balance plus billed interest charges plus any fees plus any Past Due amount, rounded up to the next whole dollar. If the balance shown on your statement is less than $35.00, your Minimum Payment Due will be the entire balance. Your receipt of a credit does not relieve you of your obligation to pay the Minimum Payment Due. You may at any time pay more than the minimum payment due without penalty. However, when you pay more than your minimum payment due it will not extend, delay or otherwise impact your payment due in the following billing period. Making only the minimum payment will increase the amount of interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance."
509,29,"PAYMENTS. The payment due date on your Account will be the same date each month and will be at least 24 days from the closing date on your statement. All payments must be made in U.S. dollars drawn on funds on deposit in the United States. You may, at any time, pay more than the monthly Minimum Payment Due or even the entire outstanding balance without a penalty. No partial prepayment will extend the due date of any succeeding payment. Payments on your Account should be mailed to us at our remittance address shown on your billing statement. Payments accompanied by the payment coupon portion of your billing statement received by us at that address before 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on any banking day will be credited to your Account as of that day. Payments received by us at any other location, or in any other form, may be subject to a delay in crediting of up to 5 days after receipt. You may not mail us cash. You agree that any payment may be returned to you if your check is: (a) missing a signature; (b) drawn with different numeric and written amounts; (c) restrictively endorsed; (d) postdated; or, (e) not paid on presentment. However, if you wish us to consider a payment marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language, such payment must be marked for special handling and sent to the “Mail Payments” address on your billing statement. You agree that we may accept any such payment, late payments, partial payments, and payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or otherwise restrictively endorsed without waiving our right to payment in full of your entire Account balance. Your Available Credit may be increased by the amount of your payment within a reasonable time after that payment is received. If you have multiple plan balances, payments in the amount of the minimum payment will be allocated to the total Minimum Payment Due. Any payment amount above the minimum payment due will be applied as follows: (1) If you have a deferred interest promotion plan balance in the last two cycles prior to expiration, excess payments will be applied to that balance first, and (2) In all other situations, we will apply excess payments to your higher interest balances."
509,30,"ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. Your check will not be returned to you by us or your bank."
509,31,"OTHER CHARGES. Other charges on your Account include the following: (a) Late Payment Fee. We may add the following fees to your purchase balance if we do not receive your minimum monthly payment by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the payment due date shown on your billing statement. The Late Payment Fee will be up to $25. If you are late more than once in a six month period, the late payment fee will go up to $35. If you make on time payments for six months, it will return to $25. (For Iowa Residents the late payment fee will be up to $15)."
509,32,"Returned Payment Fee. We may add a fee of up to $25 (up to $20 Iowa Residents) to your purchase balance when a check or other payment on your Account is not honored, when we must return it because it cannot be processed, or when an automatic debit is returned unpaid. At our option, we may assess this fee the first time your check or payment is not honored, even if it is honored upon resubmission."
509,33,"Statement Copy Fee. We may add a fee of $5 to your purchase balance for each billing statement page copy you request on your Account, unless otherwise prohibited by law."
509,34,Reissue Card Fee. We may add a fee of $5 to your purchase balance for each card that you request be reissued on your Account. We may add a fee of $30 to your purchase balance for each card if you request expedited delivery.
509,35,"Invoice/Sales Slip and Payment Copy Fee. We may add a fee of $5 to your purchase balance for each copy you request of (1) an invoice/sales slip, and (2) your payments."
509,36,Research Fee. We may add to the purchase balance a fee of $15 per hour for research that you request on your Account (unless such research discloses a billing error made by the Bank) plus $5.00 per page for any photocopie
509,37,Expedited Payment Fee. We may permit you to make a payment on your Account by authorizing us over the telephone to transfer or pay funds from your deposit account to your Fry’s Credit Account. We may impose a fee of up to $15 for each such payment authorized by you for any expedited payment facilitated by our representative.
509,38,Paper Statement Fee. We may add a fee of $1 if we mail a paper billing statement to you.
509,39,"DEFAULT. You will be in default under this Agreement if the minimum monthly payment listed on the billing statement as Minimum Payment Due is not received at the correct address on or before the payment due date, or if you breach any other provision of this Agreement, file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent or generally unable to pay your debts, or have furnished false or misleading information in applying for your Fry’s Credit Account. After your default or your death, and subject to the limitations of applicable law, we may at our option: (a) close your Account and declare the entire unpaid balance on your Account immediately due and payable, (b) require you to surrender the products purchased with any outstanding loans from your Account, and (c) exercise all other rights and remedies available to us under applicable law. In the event of your default, and subject to any limitations or requirements of applicable law, you agree to pay all costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by us (a) in collecting all amounts due on your Account, whether or not suit is brought against you, and (b) in protecting ourselves from any harm that we may suffer as a result of your default."

509,51,"ARBITRATION PROVISION. This Arbitration Provision does not apply to you if, as of the date of this Agreement, you are a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent of such member entitled to protection under the Federal Military Lending Act. Unless you exercise your right to reject arbitration under subsection (n) below, the following Arbitration Provision will apply: (a) General: Either you or we may elect to arbitrate or require the other party to arbitrate any Claim (as defined below) under the following terms and conditions. If you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (i) have a court or a jury decide the Claim; (ii) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative or a class member; (iii) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (iv) join or consolidate your Claim(s) with claims of any other person. The right to appeal and the right to discovery are more limited in arbitration than in court. Other rights that you would have if you went to court may also not be available in arbitration. (b) Definitions: The following definitions apply to this Arbitration Provision, even if terms defined in this Arbitration Provision are defined differently elsewhere in this Agreement: (i) “We,” “us” and “our” mean First Electronic Bank or any subsequent holder of this Agreement. Also, these terms include the parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and successors of such company, as well as the officers, directors, agents and employees of any of the foregoing. These terms also include any party named as a co-defendant with us in a Claim asserted by you, such as marketing companies, credit bureaus, credit insurance companies, credit card or loan servicers and debt collectors. “You,” “your” and “yours” include each and every Cardholder or Authorized User. (ii) “Administrator” means the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org, 800-778-7879; JAMS, 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018, www.jamsadr.com, 800-352-5267; or any other company selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If both AAA and JAMS cannot or will not serve and the parties are unable to select an Administrator by mutual consent, the Administrator will be selected by a court. The party initiating an arbitration selects the Administrator. Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, no arbitration may be administered, without the consent of all parties to the arbitration, by any Administrator that has in place a formal or informal policy that would purport to override subsection (d) below, captioned “No Class Actions” (the “Class Action Waiver”). (iii) “Claim” means any claim, dispute or controversy between you and us that in any way arises from or relates to this Agreement or the Account, including disputes arising from actions or omissions prior to the date of this Agreement. “Claim” has the broadest reasonable meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims. It includes disputes based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other intentional torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief). However, it does not include disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Arbitration Provision or any part thereof (including, without limitation, the Class Action Waiver, the final sentence in subsection (j) under the caption “Survival, Severability, Primacy” and/or this sentence); all such disputes are for a court and not an arbitrator to decide. However, any dispute or argument that concerns the validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a whole is for the arbitrator, not a court, to decide. Claim does not include: (1) any individual action brought by you or us in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, unless such action is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court; (2) the exercising of any self-help rights by you or us or (3) any individual action in court by one party that is limited to preventing the other party from using a self-help remedy and that does not involve a request for damages or monetary relief of any kind. The institution and/or maintenance of any such right, action or litigation will not constitute a waiver of the right of either of the parties to compel arbitration regarding any other dispute subject to arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision. (c) Starting or Demanding Arbitration: To start an arbitration, the party asserting the Claim (the “Claimant”) must commence the arbitration in accordance with the Administrator's rules. To require arbitration of a Claim, the party defending the Claim (the “Defending Party”) must give the Claimant a written demand for arbitration. This demand may be given after a lawsuit has been filed and may be given in papers or motions in the lawsuit. If an arbitration is commenced or an arbitration demand is given, the Claim shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Provision and the applicable rules of the Administrator then in effect. (d) No Class Actions: Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, if you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, neither you nor we will have the right to: (i) participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative, class member or otherwise; (ii) act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration; or (iii) join or consolidate Claims by or against you with claims by or against any other person, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to conduct any such class, private attorney general or multiple-party proceeding. (e) Location and Costs: Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in a location that is reasonably convenient for you. If you cannot obtain a waiver of the Administrator's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, we will consider in good faith any request by you for us to bear such fees. We will pay for our own attorneys, experts and witnesses and will pay the reasonable fees and charges of your attorneys, experts and witnesses if and to the extent you prevail in the arbitration. Even if you do not win the arbitration, we will pay any of the Administrator's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, and the fees and charges of your attorneys, experts and witnesses, if and to the extent we are required to pay such fees and charges by law or the Administrator’s rules or in order to make this Arbitration Provision enforceable. (f) Arbitrator Selection: The arbitrator will be appointed by the Administrator in accordance with the rules of the Administrator. However, unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator must be a retired or former judge or a lawyer with at least 10 years of experience. (g) Discovery; Getting Information: In addition to the parties' rights under the Administrator's rules to obtain information prior to the hearing, either party may ask the arbitrator for more information from the other party. The arbitrator will decide the issue in his or her sole discretion, after allowing the other party the opportunity to object. (h) Effect of Arbitration Award: Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for: (1) any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. (the “FAA”); and (2) Claims involving more than $50,000. If permitted by the Administrator’s rules, for Claims involving more than $50,000, any party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the Administrator, which will reconsider anew any aspect of the initial award that is appealed. The panel's decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA. The costs of any appeal will be borne in accordance with subsection (e) above, captioned “Location and Costs.” (i) Governing Law: This Agreement governs Transactions involving interstate commerce and accordingly this Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the FAA and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The arbitrator shall follow applicable substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA, applicable statutes of limitation and privilege rules that would apply in a court proceeding, and shall be authorized to award all remedies available in an individual lawsuit under applicable substantive law, including, without limitation, compensatory, statutory and punitive damages (which shall be governed by the constitutional standards applicable in judicial proceedings), declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. Upon the timely request of either party, the arbitrator shall write a brief explanation of the basis of his or her award. The arbitrator will follow rules of procedure and evidence consistent with the FAA, this Arbitration Provision and the Administrator's rules. (j) Survival, Severability, Primacy: This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment or default of your obligations under this Agreement and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Arbitration Provision and the Administrator's rules or other provisions of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision will govern. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision, other than the Class Action Waiver, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions shall nevertheless remain in force. If a determination is made with respect to any Claim that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, only this sentence of the Arbitration Provision will remain in force and the remaining provisions shall be null and void, provided that the determination concerning the Class Action Waiver shall be subject to appeal. (k) Amendment/Termination: Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, we will not amend this Arbitration Provision in a manner that adversely affects your rights or responsibilities in a material manner unless we give you a right to reject the amendment and/or the Arbitration Provision in its entirety. (l) Notice and Cure: Prior to initiating a lawsuit or arbitration regarding a Claim, the Claimant shall give the Defending Party written notice of the Claim (a “Claim Notice”) and a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 days, to resolve the Claim on an individual basis. Any Claim Notice to you shall be sent in writing by mail to the address for you maintained in our records. Any collection letter we send to this address shall be deemed to be a Claim Notice. Any Claim Notice to us shall be sent to us by certified mail, return receipt requested, at First Electronic Bank, P.O. 521271, Salt Lake City, UT 84152-1271(or such other address as we subsequently provide you). Any Claim Notice you send must provide your Account Number and telephone number. Any Claim Notice must explain the nature of the Claim and the relief that is demanded. The Claimant must reasonably cooperate in providing any information about the Claim that the Defending Party reasonably requests. Upon receipt of a Claim Notice, we will credit your Account for the standard cost of a certified letter. (m) Special Payment: If (i) you submit a Claim Notice on your own behalf (and not on behalf of any other party) in accordance with subsection (l), captioned “Notice and Cure” (including the timing requirements thereof); (ii) we refuse to provide you with the relief you request; and (iii) an arbitrator subsequently determines that you were entitled to such relief (or greater relief), the arbitrator shall award you at least $7,500 in addition to the attorney, witness and expert fees and costs to which you are entitled. (n) RIGHT TO REJECT ARBITRATION: You may reject this Arbitration Provision by sending us a written rejection notice in accordance with this subsection (n). We must receive the rejection notice within 45 days after we mail you a Fry’s Credit Card. You may not reject arbitration by phone or by any method other than the method described in this subsection (n). In order for a rejection notice to be valid and effective, it must: (i) state that you (or both or all of you, if more than one) wish to reject the Arbitration Provision; (ii) state your name, address and Account number; and (iii) be signed by you (or both or all of you, if more than one). If you reject this Arbitration Provision, that will not affect any other provision of this Agreement"

While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: 1) we cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount; 2) the charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount; 3) while you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance; and 4) we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: (a) If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. (b) If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill.

Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date.

(“GENESIS”), ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED.

Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

If you or we or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing.

Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076, and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules in effect at the time an arbitration is commenced that are applicable to the resolution of consumer disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”). We will tell you how to contact the AAA and how to get a copy of the Arbitration Rules without cost if you ask us in writing to do so. The Arbitration Rules permit you to request deferral or reduction of the administrative fees of arbitration if paying them would cause you a hardship. In addition, if you ask us in writing, we will consider your request to pay any or all of your costs of arbitration. Each arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney who has been engaged in the private practice of law continuously during the ten years immediately preceding the arbitration or a retired judge of a court of general or appellate jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law, including attorneys fees if allowed by applicable law or agreement. 
All statutes of limitation, defenses, and attorney-client and other privileges that would apply 
in a court proceeding will apply in the arbitration. 
If any provision of this Section regarding arbitration of disputes shall be deemed to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Section shall be given 
full force and effect. However, if the provision 
precluding class, representative or private attorney general Claims in arbitration is deemed unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement 
shall be void and of no force and effect.

a court may be used to resolve any dispute or 
claim. Rejection will not affect any other aspect of

On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Fees and Overlimit Fees. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases"

We may refuse to authorize or accept any transaction on your Account that would cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, even if you have authorized us to charge you an Overlimit Fee for doing so. We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit; however, in that case you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit. We may at any time and without prior notice to you increase or decrease your Credit Limit, limit the Credit Limit for Cash Advances or take away your ability to obtain Cash Advances."
511,7,"Monthly Statements. We will send a Statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.

If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must pay at least the Monthly Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement, which is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle. Your Monthly Minimum Payment also will include any past due amounts. If your New Balance is less than or equal to your Monthly Minimum Payment, then your Monthly Minimum Payment will be equal to your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and folowing the other instructions on the Statement to 
Genesis FS Card Services, PO Box 23030, Columbus, GA 31902-3030. Any payment received 
in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 
P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day will 
be credited to your Account that day. If your payment is received in that form and at that address 
after 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we 
will credit it to your Account the next banking day. 
However, if your Payment Due Date occurs on a 
non-banking day, any payment received the next 
day which conforms to the above requirements 
will not be treated as late. Please allow at least 
seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in 
any other form may not be credited as of the day 
we receive them. 
If we accept a payment at a place other than the 
address in the immediately preceding paragraph, 
we may delay the crediting of the payment for up 
to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late 
Fees and additional interest charges, and may 
result in your Account being declared in default. 
We do not accept cash payments through the 
mail. You may not make payments with funds 
from your Account or any other credit account 
issued by us. 
When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your 
check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer 
from your account or to process the payment as a 
check transaction. When we use information from 
your check to make an electronic fund transfer, 
funds may be withdrawn from your account as 
soon as the same day we receive your payment 
and you will not receive your check back from 
your financial institution. 
At any time, you may pay part or all of the full 
amount you owe without incurring any additional 
charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will 
be applied as a credit to your Account, and any 
remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. 
Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds. Your 
available credit on your Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days."
511,9,"Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment will be allocated in any way we determine, including to balances with lower Annual Percentage Rates before balances with higher Annual Percentage Rates. We will generally apply payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law"
511,10,"HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your interest charge for any Billing Cycle will include the following components, the total of which constitutes your total interest charge for the Billing Cycle: 1. A Cash Advance Transaction Fee imposed 
on each Cash Advance transaction posted 
during a Billing Cycle, in an amount equal 
to the greater of $5 or 5% of the amount 
of each Cash Advance, not to exceed $100. 
Any unpaid Cash Advance Transaction Fee 
will be added to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. 
2. Periodic interest charge computed by applying the applicable Monthly Periodic 
Rate or Rates, determined as provided below under Computing the Purchase and 
Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic 
Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) to: 
a. your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances); 
and 
b. your Average Daily Balance of Purchases 
(including new Purchases). 
However, if the total of the amounts so 
computed is an amount less than $1, then 
a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be 
imposed instead of such smaller amounts. 
3. A Foreign Currency Conversion Fee in an 
amount equal to 1% of the converted U.S. 
dollar amount of each transaction, including Cash Advances and Purchases, that 
is effected in any currency other than U.S. 
dollars"
511,11,"When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue. Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle. 2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. There is no grace"
511,12,"period on Cash Advances and there is no period within which to pay to avoid interest charges on Cash Advances. Calculating the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid fees, interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases and new fees as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Fees and Overlimit Fees. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases"
511,13,"Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates: The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. The Purchase APR is 24.9% and the standard Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.075%. The Cash Advance APR is 29.9% and the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.492%."
511,14,"Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.492%. OTHER FEES In addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. Annual Fee. We will charge an initial Annual Fee of $75 to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee of $99 on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice"
511,15,"newal Annual Fee notice. Late Fee. If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Fee to your Account. The Late Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Late Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles."
511,16,"Minimum Interest Charge Fee. If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion."
511,17,"Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $40. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment."
511,18,"Overlimit Fee. If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee is $29 if you were not charged an Overlimit Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Overlimit Fee is $40. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle."

If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must pay at least the Monthly Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement, which is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle. Your Monthly Minimum Payment also will include any past due amounts. If your New Balance is less than or equal to your Monthly Minimum Payment, then your Monthly Minimum Payment will be equal to your New Balance.

Any payment received in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If your payment is received in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. However, if your Payment Due Date occurs on a non-banking day, any payment received the next day which conforms to the above requirements will not be treated as late. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at a place other than the address in the immediately preceding paragraph, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your Account or any other credit account issued by us. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all of the full amount you owe without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds. Your available credit on your Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 day"

For each Billing Cycle, payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment will be allocated in any way we determine, including to balances with lower Annual Percentage Rates before balances with higher Annual Percentage Rates. We will generally apply payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law"
513,9,"Your interest charge for any Billing Cycle will include the following components, the total of which constitutes your total interest charge for the Billing Cycle: 1. A Cash Advance Transaction Fee imposed 
on each Cash Advance transaction posted 
during a Billing Cycle, in an amount equal 
to the greater of $5 or 5% of the amount 
of each Cash Advance, not to exceed $100. 
Any unpaid Cash Advance Transaction Fee 
will be added to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. 
2. Periodic interest charge computed by applying the applicable Monthly Periodic 
Rate or Rates, determined as provided below under Computing the Purchase and 
Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic 
Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) to:
a. your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances); 
and
b. your Average Daily Balance of Purchases 
(including new Purchases).
However, if the total of the amounts so 
computed is an amount less than $1, then 
a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be 
imposed instead of such smaller amounts. 
3. A Foreign Currency Conversion Fee in an 
amount equal to 1% of the converted U.S. 
dollar amount of each transaction, including Cash Advances and Purchases, that 
is effected in any currency other than U.S. 
dollars"
513,10,"When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue. Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle. 2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. There is no grac"

Calculating the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid fees, interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases and new fees as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Fees and Overlimit Fees. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases"
513,12,"Purchases. Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates: The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. The Purchase APR is 29.9% and the standard Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.492%. The Cash Advance APR is 29.9% and the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.492%"
513,13,"OTHER FEES In addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. Annual Fee. We will charge an initial Annual Fee of $125 to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee of $125 on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice. Late Fee. If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Fee to your Account. The Late Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Late Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles"
513,14,"Otherwise, the Late Fee is $40. The Late Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Minimum Interest Charge Fee. If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion. Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $40. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Overlimit Fee. If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee is $29 if you were not charged an Overlimit Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Overlimit Fee is $40. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle"
513,15,"during the Billing Cycle. Documentation Fee. You may request a copy of a Statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per Statement, which will be applied to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account.

marked “paid in full,” “without recourse,” or 
similar language. If you send such a payment, 
we may accept it without losing any of our

Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date.

After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a Statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you ow"

Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the Purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O.

If you use your Account number without presenting your actual Card, such as for mail, telephone, or internet purchases, this will be treated the same way as if you presented your Card.

Such limitations and restrictions include, but are not limited to, gambling transactions, which include, but are not limited to, internet-related lottery tickets, casino gambling chips, off-track betting and wagers at racetracks. You remain responsible for use of your Account/ Card in any such transactions. The Card may only be used for valid and lawful purposes.

Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at a place other than the address in the immediately preceding paragraph, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your Account or any other credit account issued by us.

514,9,"When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue. Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle. 2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances"

Calculating the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid fees, interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases and new fees as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Fees and Overlimit Fees. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases. Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates: The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. The Purchase APR is 29.9% and the standard Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.492%. The Cash Advance APR is 29.9% and the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.492%."
514,11,"In addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. Annual Fee. We will charge an initial Annual Fee of $75 to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee of $99 on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice. Late Fee. If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Fee to your Account. The Late Fee is $29 if you were not charged a"

Minimum Interest Charge Fee. If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion. Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $40. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment"
514,13,"Overlimit Fee. If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee is $29 if you were not charged an Overlimit Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Overlimit Fee is $40. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle. Documentation Fee. You may request a copy of a Statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per Statement, which will be applied to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account.

Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date.

UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS FS CARD SERVICES, INC. (“GENESIS”), ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. THIS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES OR A DEPENDENT OF SUCH MEMBER ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. PLEASE SEE THE SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT LABELED “MILITARY LENDING ACT.” IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT, YOU MAY CONTACT US AT 1-800-583-5698. This provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter what happens to your Account, including the closing of your Account. Except as expressly provided below, you must arbitrate individually, by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), any dispute or claim between you, any joint Cardholder and/or Authorized User, on the one hand, and us , our affiliates, and agents, and/or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises out of or is related to (a) this Agreement (including without limitation, any dispute over the validity of this Agreement to arbitrate disputes or of this entire Agreement), or Account. We will not do this for you. If we close or permanently suspend your Account, you must also return all Cards to us. You must still pay us all amounts you owe on the Account, even if they are charged after your Account is closed or suspended. Additional Benefits and Services. From time to time, we may offer you benefits and services with your Account. These benefits and services may be provided by us or third parties. Unless expressly made a part of this Agreement, and except as provided in the Arbitration of Disputes section below, any such benefits and services are not a part of this Agreement, and are subject only to the terms and conditions outlined in the benefits or services brochure and other official documents provided to you with respect to the benefits and services.

Except as required by applicable law, we are not liable for benefits or services provided by third parties or the actions or omissions of those third parties. Foreign Currency Conversion. Payment must be made in U.S. Dollars for charges you incur in any other currency. If you effect a transaction with your Card in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard”) will convert the charge into a U.S. Dollar amount. Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date. We will also assess a Foreign Currency Conversion Fee interest charge as described in the “How Interest Charges are Determined” section. Honoring Your Card. We are not responsible if anyone refuses to accept your Card or Account for any reason. Although you may have credit available, we may decline any transaction for any reason. We are not liable for any refusal to honor your Card or Account.

523,2,"This Agreement contains the terms that govern the use of your Destiny Mastercard Account and outlines both your responsibilities and ours. Please read it in its entirety and keep it for your reference. In addition, any written application, acceptance certificate or other request you signed or otherwise submitted for this Account (the “Application”), your Card and the Card Carrier that we send with your Card, and your signature (including any electronic or digital signature) on any Application, sales slip or other evidence of indebtedness on your Account, are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. This Agreement begins on the earlier of (i) the date you sign or otherwise submit an Application that is approved by us, or (ii) the first date that we extend credit to you on your Account, as evidenced by a signed sales slip or memorandum, a Cash Advance transaction, or otherwise. Definitions. To simplify this Agreement for you, the definitions listed below will apply throughout, both in this Agreement and in your monthly Statements. In addition, the words you, your, and yours refer to the Cardholder(s) who holds the Card and is responsible for the Account, each of whom is individually and jointly obligated under this Agreement. The words we, us, and our refer to First Electronic Bank. Account: The credit card account for which you were issued a Card imprinted with your Account number and that is subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. ATM: Automated Teller Machine. Billing Cycle: The time interval covered by a monthly Statement. Each Billing Cycle is approximately 30 days in length; however, the specific period of time is described on each monthly Statement. Your Account will have a Billing Cycle even if a Statement is not required. Card: Any Destiny Mastercard issued by us that you may use to obtain a Cash Advance, make Purchases, or lease goods or services on credit. Use of your Account number to obtain credit will be considered a use of the Card. Card Carrier: The carrier that contains your Card. Cardholder: The person to whom a Card is issued, or who has agreed to pay obligations arising from a Card issued to another person. Cash Advance: Credit extended to you in the form of a cash loan through any financial institution honoring the Card either presented directly or through any other credit instrument, check, device, overdraft coverage plan or ATM that we make available to you or that you use. All cash equivalent transactions will be treated as Cash Advances and will be billed to the Cash Advance segment of your Account.

Closing Date: The date of the last day of a Billing Cycle. Credit Limit: The maximum amount of credit available to you on your Account.

523,3,"Purchases and Cash Advances. You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services from participating merchants. You may also use your Card to obtain Cash Advances from your Account at an ATM, or by presenting it to any institution that accepts the Card for that purpose. There are dollar limitations on individual Cash Advance transactions, and we may set a Cash Advance Limit for your Account. Please contact us for information about the Cash Advance limitations"
523,4,"that apply to your Account. In addition, we may limit your Account to only one Cash Advance transaction per day. You promise to pay us and are liable for all amounts resulting from the authorized use of your Card or Account, plus any applicable interest charges and other applicable charges or fees, payable in U.S. dollars. This includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other documents for the transaction. If you use your Account number without presenting your actual Card, such as for mail, telephone, or internet purchases, this will be treated the same way as if you presented your Card. Your promise to pay us will apply to your estate if you die. We may limit and restrict the use of the Account/Card at our discretion. Such limitations and restrictions include, but are not limited to, gambling transactions, which include, but are not limited to, internet-related lottery tickets, casino gambling chips, off-track betting and wagers at racetracks. You remain responsible for use of your Account/Card in any such transactions. The Card may only be used for valid and lawful purposes. If you use, or you authorize someone else to use, the Card or Account for an unlawful or impermissible purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us or Mastercard for any amounts or expenses we or they incur as a result of such use. The Card is and remains our property, and you will surrender it to us at any time upon request. Your Credit Limit. You may not use your Account in any way that would cause you to go over your Credit Limit. We may refuse to authorize or accept any transaction on your Account that would cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, even if you have authorized us to charge you an Overlimit Fee for doing so. We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit; however, in that case you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit. We may at any time and without prior notice to you increase or decrease your Credit Limit, limit the Credit Limit for Cash Advances or take away your ability to obtain Cash Advances"
523,5,"MAKING PAYMENTS Monthly Statements. We will send a Statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Monthly Minimum Payment. The Monthly Minimum Payment is 7% of your New Balance or $40, whichever is greater, rounded to near"
523,6,"est dollar. If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must pay at least the Monthly Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement, which is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle. Your Monthly Minimum Payment also will include any past due amounts. If your New Balance is less than or equal to your Monthly Minimum Payment, then your Monthly Minimum Payment will be equal to your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the Statement to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 23030, Columbus, GA 31902-3030. Any payment received in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If your payment is received in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. However, if your Payment Due Date occurs on a non-banking day, any payment received the next day which conforms to the above requirements will not be treated as late. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at a place other than the address in the immediately preceding paragraph, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your Account or any other credit account issued by us. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all of the full amount you owe without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds. Your available credit on your Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days. Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment will be allocated in any way we determine, including to balances with lower Annual Percentage Rates before balances with higher Annual Percentage"
523,7,"of your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law. HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your interest charge for any Billing Cycle will include the following components, the total of which constitutes your total interest charge for the Billing Cycle: 1. A Cash Advance Transaction Fee imposed on each Cash Advance transaction posted during a Billing Cycle, in an amount equal to the greater of $5 or 5% of the amount of each Cash Advance, not to exceed $100. Any unpaid Cash Advance Transaction Fee will be added to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. 2. Periodic interest charge computed by applying the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate or Rates, determined as provided below under Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) to: a. your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances); and b. your Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases). However, if the total of the amounts so computed is an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be imposed instead of such smaller amounts. 3. A Foreign Currency Conversion Fee in an amount equal to 1% of the converted U.S. dollar amount of each transaction, including Cash Advances and Purchases, that is effected in any currency other than U.S. dollars."
523,8,"When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue. Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle"
523,9,"2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. There is no grace period on Cash Advances and there is no period within which to pay to avoid interest charges on Cash Advances. Calculating the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid fees, interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases and new fees as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Fees and Overlimit Fees. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases. Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances"
523,10,"Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates: The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. See the Pricing Information for the APRs and Monthly Periodic Rates. OTHER FEES In addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below"
523,11,"Annual Fee. We will charge an initial Annual Fee to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice. If your Account has an initial and renewal Annual Fee, see the Pricing Information for the amount of the Fee. Monthly Fee. We will charge a Monthly Fee to your Account at the close of each Billing Cycle unless you notify us to cancel your Account. Your payment of the Monthly Fee does not in any way limit any of our rights or remedies under this Agreement, in law, or in equity, including without limitation, our right to close your Account or limit transactions on your Account pursuant to this Agreement. If your Account has a Monthly Fee, see the Pricing Information for the amount of the Fee. Late Fee. If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Fee to your Account. The Late Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. See the Pricing Information for the amount of the Late Fee"
523,12,"Minimum Interest Charge Fee. If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion. Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. See the Pricing Information for the amount of the Returned Payment Fee. Overlimit Fee. If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle. See the Pricing Information for the amount of the Overlimit Fee. Documentation Fee. You may request a copy of a Statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per Statement, which will be applied to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation"
523,13,"Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account.

Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date. We will also assess a Foreign Currency Conversion Fee interest charge as described in the “How Interest Charges are Determined” section. Honoring Your Card.

This provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter what happens to your Account, including the closing of your Account. Except as expressly provided below, you must arbitrate individually, by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), any dispute or claim between you, any joint Cardholder and/ or Authorized User, on the one hand, and us , our affiliates, and agents, and/or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises out of or is related to (a) this Agreement (including without limitation, any dispute over the validity of this Agreement to arbitrate disputes or of this entire Agreement), or (b) your Account, or (c) any relationship resulting from this Agreement, or (d) any insurance or other service related to your Account, or (e) any other agreement related to your Account (including prior agreements) or any such service, or (f) breach of this Agreement or any other such agreement, whether based on statute, contract, tort or any other legal theory (any “Claim”).

THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CONSIDER SUCH CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS OR ANY SUCH CLAIMS YOU BRING ON BEHALF OF AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any dispute regarding whether a particular controversy is subject to arbitration, or the applicability or enforceability of the foregoing paragraph, will be decided by a court and not by an arbitrator. If you or we or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. The notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to Genesis FS Card Services, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Demand, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076, and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules in effect at the time an arbitration is commenced that are applicable to the resolution of consumer disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”). We will tell you how to contact the AAA and how to get a copy of the Arbitration Rules without cost if you ask us in writing to do so. The Arbitration Rules permit you to request deferral or reduction of the administrative fees of arbitration if paying them would cause you a hardship. In addition, if you ask us in writing, we will consider your request to pay any or all of your costs of arbitration. Each arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney who has been engaged in the private practice of law continuously during the ten years immediately preceding the arbitration or a retired judge of a court of general or appellate jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law, including attorneys’ fees if allowed by applicable law or agreement. All statutes of limitation, defenses, and attorney-client and other privileges that would apply in a court proceeding will apply in the arbitration. If any provision of this Section regarding arbitration of disputes shall be deemed to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Section shall be given full force and effect. However, if the provision precluding class, representative or private attorney general Claims in arbitration is deemed unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be void and of no force and effect. You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute or claim. Rejection will not affect any other aspect of the Agreement. To reject this Provision, you must send us a notice within"

YOUR BILLING RIGHTS – KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your Statement, please write to us at: Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076- 4499. In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and Account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Statement. • At least three (3) business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors, and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your Statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit"
523,26,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a Statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct. Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the Purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076-4499. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent"

If you use, or you authorize someone else to use, the Card or Account for an unlawful or impermissible purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us or Mastercard for any amounts or expenses we or they incur as a result of such use. The Card is and remains our property, and you will surrender it to us at any time upon request. Your Credit Limit. You may not use your Account in any way that would cause you to go over your Credit Limit. We may refuse to authorize or accept any transaction on your Account that would cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, even if you have authorized us to charge you an Overlimit Fee for doing so. We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit; however, in that case you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit. We may at any time and without prior notice to you increase or decrease your Credit Limit, limit the Credit Limit for Cash Advances or take away your ability to obtain Cash Advances."
528,5,"MAKING PAYMENTS Monthly Statements. We will send a Statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Monthly Minimum Payment. The Monthly Minimum Payment is 7% of your New Balance or $40, whichever is greater, rounded to nearest dollar. If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must pay at least the Monthly Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement, which is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle. Your Monthly Minimum Payment also will include any past due amounts. If your New Balance is less than or equal to your Monthly Minimum Payment, then your Monthly Minimum Payment will be equal to your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following"
528,6,"the other instructions on the Statement to Genesis FS Card Services, PO Box 23030, Columbus, GA 31902-3030. Any payment received in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If your payment is received in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. However, if your Payment Due Date occurs on a non-banking day, any payment received the next day which conforms to the above requirements will not be treated as late. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at a place other than the address in the immediately preceding paragraph, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your Account or any other credit account issued by us. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all of the full amount you owe without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds. Your available credit on your Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days"
528,7,"your payments for up to 14 days. Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment will be allocated in any way we determine, including to balances with lower Annual Percentage Rates before balances with higher Annual Percentage Rates. We will generally apply payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law. HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your interest charge for any Billing Cycle will include the following components, the total of which constitutes your total interest charge for the Billing Cycle: 1. A Cash Advance Transaction Fee imposed on each Cash Advance transaction posted during a Billing Cycle, in an amount equa"
528,8,"to the greater of $5 or 5% of the amount of each Cash Advance, not to exceed $100. Any unpaid Cash Advance Transaction Fee will be added to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. 2. Periodic interest charge computed by applying the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate or Rates, determined as provided below under Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) to: a. your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances); and b. your Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases). However, if the total of the amounts so computed is an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be imposed instead of such smaller amounts. 3. A Foreign Currency Conversion Fee in an amount equal to 1% of the converted U.S. dollar amount of each transaction, including Cash Advances and Purchases, that is effected in any currency other than U.S. dollars."
528,9,"When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue. Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle. 2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. There is no grace period on Cash Advances and there is no period within which to pay to avoid interest charges on Cash Advances"
528,10,"Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid fees, interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases and new fees as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Fees and Overlimit Fees. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases. Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates: The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. The Purchase APR is 24.9% and the standard Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.075%. The Cash Advance APR is 29.9% and the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.492%."
528,11,"OTHER FEES In addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. Annual Fee. We will charge an initial Annual Fee of $59 to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee of $59 on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice. Late Fee. If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Fee to your Account. The Late Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Late Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Late Fee is $40. The Late Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Minimum Interest Charge Fee. If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How"
528,12,"Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $1, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $1 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion. Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $40. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Overlimit Fee. If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee is $29 if you were not charged an Overlimit Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Overlimit Fee is $40. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle. Documentation Fee. You may request a copy of a Statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per Statement, which will be applied to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not impose any fee in connection with a good faith assertion of a billing error or other exercise of your Billing Rights (see below under “Your Billing Rights - Keep This Notice for Future Use”)"

If a merchant agrees to give you a refund for goods or services purchased with your Card or Account, you will accept a credit on your Account instead of a cash refund. We do not control when a merchant sends us your refund and we will have a reasonable amount of time after we receive your refund to process it. No Waiver of Rights; Disputed Amounts. We can accept late or partial payments without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. You agree not to send us partial payments marked “paid in full,” “without recourse,” or similar language.

All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicated that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, Oregon 97076. Credit Reports and Information.

You agree to pay our reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees and expenses related to the collection of your Account, and retrieving your Card, to the extent permitted by applicable laws"

You will retain for Statement verification your copy of each Purchase slip, Cash Advance or other transaction to your Account."
528,20,"Transfer of Your Account. You may not transfer your Account to any other person. We may assign your Account or amounts owing under your Account to any other person at any time and the assignee will take our place under the Agreement with respect to all agreements and interests transferred. You must pay the assignee and otherwise perform your obligations under the assigned agreements and interests. Closing or Suspending Your Account. We may close or suspend your Account or your ability to obtain credit on your Account, or both, at any time, for any reason permitted by law and with or without advance notice. You may close your Account at any time by contacting us. The closure of Account will not become effective until you have returned to us all of the Cards we have given you. If you have a joint Account and want to remove one of the names from the Account, we must receive a written request signed by both of the Cardholders on the Account and all Cards must be returned upon request. No party is released from the obligation for the balance owing on a joint Account, unless we agree to the arrangements in writing.

If your Account is closed or suspended for any reason, you must stop using your Card. You must also cancel all billing arrangements to the Account. We will not do this for you. If we close or permanently suspend your Account, you must also return all Cards to us. You must still pay us all amounts you owe on the Account, even if they are charged after your Account is closed or suspended. Additional Benefits and Services. From time"
528,21,"to time, we may offer you benefits and services with your Account. These benefits and services may be provided by us or third parties. Unless expressly made a part of this Agreement, and except as provided in the Arbitration of Disputes section below, any such benefits and services are not a part of this Agreement, and are subject only to the terms and conditions outlined in the benefits or services brochure and other official documents provided to you with respect to the benefits and services. We may adjust, add, or delete benefits or services at any time in accordance with the brochures or documents you receive. Except as required by applicable law, we are not liable for benefits or services provided by third parties or the actions or omissions of those third parties. Foreign Currency Conversion. Payment must be made in U.S. Dollars for charges you incur in any other currency. If you effect a transaction with your Card in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard”) will convert the charge into a U.S. Dollar amount. Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date. We will also assess a Foreign Currency Conversion Fee interest charge as described in the “How Interest Charges are Determined” section"
528,22,"Honoring Your Card. We are not responsible if anyone refuses to accept your Card or Account for any reason. Although you may have credit available, we may decline any transaction for any reason. We are not liable for any refusal to honor your Card or Account. From time to time, due to circumstances beyond our control (such as system failures, natural disasters, or other unpredictable events), our services may not be available. When this happens, you may be unable to use your Card or obtain information about your Account. We will not be responsible or liable if this happens. Change of Address, Employment and Telephone. We will send all written notices and Statements to your address as it appears on our records. To avoid delays and missed payments that could affect your credit standing, you agree to promptly advise us if you change your mailing address, place of employment, or telephone number. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.

We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your Statement, and we may continue to"
528,28,"charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a Statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct."
528,29,"Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the Purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076-4499. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision.

529,6,"Purchases. You may use your Account to purchase goods and services from Retailer. You promise to pay us and are liable for all amounts resulting from the authorized use of your Account Number or Account, plus any applicable interest charges and other applicable charges or fees, payable in U.S. dollars.

We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit. If we do so, in that case, you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit."
529,7,"Monthly Statements. We will send a statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your Account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Monthly Minimum Payment. Your monthly minimum payment due will be the greater of: 1. $15; or 2. The sum of: a. Each fixed monthly payment amount applicable to each of your Purchases (described below), plus b. 5% of your Regular Balance."
529,8,"Each Purchase will have a fixed monthly payment amount which we calculate when the Purchase is posted to your Account. We determine the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase by multiplying the Purchase amount by 5%, and then rounding the result to the nearest dollar. If the remaining balance of a Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is less than the fixed monthly payment amount, we will reduce the fixed monthly payment amount for that Purchase accordingly. We will continue to include the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase in the monthly minimum payment due until the Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is paid in full. If you make a payment in excess of the monthly minimum payment due for any month, it will not reduce the fixed monthly payment amount applicable to any Purchase that is used to calculate your monthly minimum payment due in subsequent months, but it may result in your paying off a Purchase more quickly. Your monthly minimum payment due also will include the greater of (i) any past due amount, or (ii) any amount by which the New Balance exceeded your Credit Limit. Your monthly minimum payment due will never exceed your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the monthly statement to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 84049, Columbus, Georgia 31908. Any payment we receive in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If we receive your payment in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day, or any time on a nonbanking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments we receive at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at some other place, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all you owe on your Account without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds, and your total Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days."
529,9,"Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, we will allocate payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment to charges and principal due (including new transactions) in any way we determine. We will generally apply payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your monthly minimum payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law. During the last two Billing Cycles of a deferred interest period, if you have an outstanding deferred interest balance, we will apply these excess amounts to the deferred interest promotion balance."
529,10,"Each Purchase on your Account is subject to up to 6 months of deferred interest, beginning on the date of the Purchase (the “deferred interest period”). Interest will be charged to your Account from the date of the Purchase if the Purchase balance is not paid in full within the deferred interest period or if you make a late payment. Each Purchase transaction accrues interest from the Date of the Purchase, but we will not charge that interest to your Account if you pay that Purchase balance in full before the end of the deferred interest period and you make monthly minimum payments as required. The deferred interest period will end when one or more of the following events occur: • 6 months from the Purchase date; • Your Account becomes more than 180 days past due; • Your Account is charged off for any reason. Interest on each Purchase transaction will accrue during the deferred interest period at 34.9% APR. You must make monthly minimum payments during the deferred interest period. The monthly statement we send you will include these monthly minimum payment amounts and will help you keep track of your Purchase balance(s) and their deferred interest period(s). Paying only the monthly minimum payment may not pay off the Purchase balance within the deferred interest period. You may have to make additional or increased payments during the deferred interest period to avoid having to pay all accrued deferred interest. After the deferred interest period, interest will be charged at 34.9% APR."
529,11,"Your Interest Rate. We use a daily periodic rate to calculate the interest on your account. The daily periodic rate is the applicable APR multiplied by 1/365. The daily periodic rate for your account is 0.0956% and the applicable APR is 34.9%. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest on your Purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full. How We Calculate Interest. We calculate interest separately for each balance segment on your Account. We do this by applying the daily periodic rate to your average daily balance (including new Purchases), and then multiplying the resulting number by the number of days in the Billing Cycle for each balance segment. An average daily balance is calculated for the following balance segments as applicable: Purchase Balance segments and the Regular Balance segment. We calculate interest for each balance segment as follows: 1. For each day, we take the beginning balance of each balance segment in the billing cycle, including any unpaid interest charges, add any new purchases and debits, and then subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits. This gives us the daily balance. Late Payment Fees, Returned Payment Fees, and Documentation Fees are not included in the daily balance. 2. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 3. Next, we multiply the daily periodic rate by the average daily balance. 4. Finally, we take the resulting number from #3 and multiply it by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the interest charge for each balance segment for the billing cycle"
529,12,"In addition to interest charges, other fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. The amounts of these fees may change from time to time during the term of your Account. Late Payment Fee. If we do not receive your monthly minimum payment due by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will apply a Late Payment Fee to your Account. The Late Payment Fee is $28 if we did not charge a Late Payment Fee during any of the prior six billing periods. Otherwise, the Late Payment Fee is $39. The Late Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required monthly minimum payment. Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will apply a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $28 if we did not charge a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six billing periods. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $39. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the monthly minimum payment. Documentation Fee. You may request a copy of a monthly statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per statement, which fee we will charge to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not impose any fee in connection with a good faith assertion of a billing error or other exercise of your Billing Rights (see below under “Your Billing Rights - Keep This Notice for Future Use”)."

What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your statement, please write to us at: Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076. In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and Account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. • At least three (3) business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors, and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct."
529,26,"While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your Statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit line. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct."
529,27,"Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Account Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your Account for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision.

530,8,"Monthly Statements. We will send a statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your Account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed or as otherwise required by applicable law.

Your monthly minimum payment due will be the greater of: 1. $15; or 2. The sum of: a. Each fixed monthly payment amount applicable to each of your Purchases (described below), plus b. 5% of your Regular Balance."
530,9,"Each Purchase will have a fixed monthly payment amount which we calculate when the Purchase is posted to your Account. We determine the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase by multiplying the Purchase amount by 5%, and then rounding the result to the nearest dollar. If the remaining balance of a Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is less than the fixed monthly payment amount, we will reduce the fixed monthly payment amount for that Purchase accordingly. We will continue to include the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase in the monthly minimum payment due until the Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is paid in full. If you make a payment in excess of the monthly minimum payment due for any month, it will not reduce the fixed monthly payment amount applicable to any Purchase that is used to calculate your monthly minimum payment due in subsequent months, but it may result in your paying off a Purchase more quickly. Your monthly minimum payment due also will include the greater of (i) any past due amount, or (ii) any amount by which the New Balance exceeded your Credit Limit. Your monthly minimum payment due will never exceed your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the monthly statement to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 84049, Columbus, Georgia 31908. Any payment we receive in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If we receive your payment in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day, or any time on a nonbanking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments we receive at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at some other place, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution."
530,10,"At any time, you may pay part or all you owe on your Account without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds, and your total Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days. Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, we will allocate payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment to charges and principal due (including new transactions) in any way we determine. We will generally apply payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your monthly minimum payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law. During the last two Billing Cycles of a deferred interest period, if you have an outstanding deferred interest balance, we will apply these excess amounts to the deferred interest promotion balance"
530,11,"DEFERRED INTEREST Each Purchase on your Account is subject to up to 12 months of deferred interest, beginning on the date of the Purchase (the “deferred interest period”). Interest will be charged to your Account from the date of the Purchase if the Purchase balance is not paid in full within the deferred interest period or if you make a late payment. Each Purchase transaction accrues interest from the Date of the Purchase, but we will not charge that interest to your Account if you pay that Purchase balance in full before the end of the deferred interest period and you make monthly minimum payments as required. The deferred interest period will end when one or more of the following events occur: • 12 months from the Purchase date; • Your Account becomes more than 180 days past due; • Your Account is charged off for any reason. Interest on each Purchase transaction will accrue during the deferred interest period at 34.9% APR. You must make monthly minimum payments during the deferred interest period. The monthly statement we send you will include these monthly minimum payment amounts and will help you keep track of your Purchase balance(s) and their deferred interest period(s). Paying only the monthly minimum payment may not pay off the Purchase balance within the deferred interest period. You may have to make additional or increased payments during the deferred interest period to avoid having to pay all accrued deferred interest. After the deferred interest period, interest will be charged at 34.9% APR."
530,12,"HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your Interest Rate. We use a daily periodic rate to calculate the interest on your account. The daily periodic rate is the applicable APR multiplied by 1/365. The daily periodic rate for your account is 0.0956% and the applicable APR is 34.9%. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest on your Purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full. How We Calculate Interest. We calculate interest separately for each balance segment on your Account. We do this by applying the daily periodic rate to your average daily balance (including new Purchases), and then multiplying the resulting number by the number of days in the Billing Cycle for each balance segment. An average daily balance is calculated for the following balance segments as applicable: Purchase Balance segments and the Regular Balance segment. We calculate interest for each balance segment as follows: 1. For each day, we take the beginning balance of each balance segment in the billing cycle, including any unpaid interest charges, add any new purchases and debits, and then subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits. This gives us the daily balance. Late Payment Fees, Returned Payment Fees, and Documentation Fees are not included in the daily balance. 2. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 3. Next, we multiply the daily periodic rate by the average daily balance. 4. Finally, we take the resulting number from #3 and multiply it by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the interest charge for each balance segment for the billing cycle"
530,13,"OTHER FEES In addition to interest charges, other fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. The amounts of these fees may change from time to time during the term of your Account. Late Payment Fee. If we do not receive your monthly minimum payment due by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will apply a Late Payment Fee to your Account. The Late Payment Fee is $28 if we did not charge a Late Payment Fee during any of the prior six billing periods. Otherwise, the Late Payment Fee is $39. The Late Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required monthly minimum payment. Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will apply a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $28 if we did not charge a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six billing periods. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $39. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the monthly minimum payment. Documentation Fee. You may request a copy of a monthly statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per statement, which fee we will charge to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not impose any fee in connection with a good faith assertion of a billing error or other exercise of your Billing Rights (see below under “Your Billing Rights - Keep This Notice for Future Use”)."

If you or we elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. The notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to Genesis FS Card Services, Attn: Arbitration Demand, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076, and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules in effect at the time an arbitration is commenced that are applicable to the resolution of consumer disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”). We will tell you how to contact the AAA and how to get a copy of the Arbitration Rules without cost if you ask us in writing to do so. The Arbitration Rules permit you to request deferral or reduction of the administrative fees of arbitration if paying them would cause you a hardship. In addition, if you ask us in writing, we will consider your request to pay any or all of your costs of arbitration. Each arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney who has been engaged in the private practice of law continuously during the ten years immediately preceding the arbitration or a retired judge of a court of general or appellate jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law, including attorneys’ fees if allowed by applicable law or agreement. All statutes of limitation, defenses, and attorney-client and other privileges that would apply in a court proceeding will apply in the arbitration. If any provision of this Section regarding arbitration of disputes shall be deemed to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Section shall be given full force and effect. However, if the provision precluding class, representative or private attorney general Claims in arbitration is deemed unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be void and of no force and effect."
530,25,"You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute or claim. Rejection will not affect any other aspect of the Agreement. To reject this Provision, you must send us a notice within 60 days after you open your Account or we first provide you with a right to reject this Provision. This notice must include your name, address and Account number and be mailed to Genesis FS Card Services, Attn: Arbitration Provision, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076. This is the only way you can reject this Provision. YOUR BILLING RIGHTS – KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your statement, please write to us at: Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076. In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and Account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. • At least three (3) business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors, and you may have to pay the amount in question"
530,26,"What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your Statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit line. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct"
530,27,"Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Account Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your Account for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent."
531,1,"This Agreement contains the terms that govern the use of your Destiny Mastercard Account and outlines both your responsibilities and ours. Please read it in its entirety and keep it for your reference. In addition, any written application, acceptance certificate or other request you signed or otherwise submitted for this Account (the “Application”), your Card and the Card Carrier that we send with your Card, and your signature (including any electronic or digital signature) on any Application, sales slip or other evidence of indebtedness on your Account, are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. This Agreement begins on the earlier of (i) the date you sign or otherwise submit an Application that is approved by us, or (ii) the first date that we extend credit to you on your Account, as evidenced by a signed sales slip or memorandum, a Cash Advance transaction, or otherwise."
531,2,"To simplify this Agreement for you, the definitions listed below will apply throughout, both in this Agreement and in your monthly Statements. In addition, the words you, your, and yours refer to the Cardholder(s) who holds the Card and is responsible for the Account, each of whom is individually and jointly obligated under this Agreement. The words we, us, and our refer to First Electronic Bank. Account: The credit card account for which you were issued a Card imprinted with your Account number and that is subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. ATM: Automated Teller Machine. Billing Cycle: The time interval covered by a monthly Statement.

Use of your Account number to obtain credit will be considered a use of the Card. Card Carrier: The carrier that contains your Card.

Cash Advance: Credit extended to you in the form of a cash loan through any financial institution honoring the Card either presented directly or through any other credit instrument, check, device, overdraft coverage plan or ATM that we make available to you or that you use. All cash equivalent transactions will be treated as Cash Advances and will be billed to the Cash Advance segment of your Account.

Closing Date: The date of the last day of a Billing Cycle. Credit Limit: The maximum amount of credit available to you on your Account.

531,3,"Purchases and Cash Advances You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services from participating merchants. You may also use your Card to obtain Cash Advances from your Account at an ATM, or by presenting it to any institution that accepts the Card for that purpose. There are dollar limitations on individual Cash Advance transactions, and we may set a Cash Advance Limit for your Account. Please contact us for information about the Cash Advance limitations that apply to your Account. In addition, we may limit your Account to only one Cash Advance transaction per day. You promise to pay us and are liable for all amounts resulting from the authorized use of your Card or Account, plus any applicable interest charges and other applicable charges or fees, payable in U.S. dollars. This includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other documents for the transaction. If you use your Account number without presenting your actual Card, such as for mail, telephone, or internet purchases, this will be treated the same way as if you presented your Card. Your promise to pay us will apply to your estate if you die. We may limit and restrict the use of the Account/Card at our discretion. Such limitations and restrictions include, but are not limited to, gambling transactions, which include, but are not limited to, internet-related lottery tickets, casino gambling chips, off-track betting and wagers at racetracks. You remain responsible for use of your Account/Card in any such transactions. The Card may only be used for valid and lawful purposes. If you use, or you authorize someone else to use, the Card or Account for an unlawful or impermissible purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us or Mastercard for any amounts or expenses we or they incur as a result of such use. The Card is and remains our property, and you will surrender it to us at any time upon request."
531,4,"Your Credit Limit You may not use your Account in any way that would cause you to go over your Credit Limit. We may refuse to authorize or accept any transaction on your Account that would cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, even if you have authorized us to charge you an Overlimit Fee for doing so. We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit; however, in that case you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit. We may at any time and without prior notice to you increase or decrease your Credit Limit, limit the Credit Limit for Cash Advances or take away your ability to obtain Cash Advances."
531,5,"Monthly Statements We will send a Statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution."
531,6,"Monthly Minimum Payment The Monthly Minimum Payment is 7% of your New Balance or $40, whichever is greater. If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must pay at least the Monthly Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement, which is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle. Your Monthly Minimum Payment also will include any past due amount or any amount by which the New Balance exceeds your Credit Limit, whichever is greater. If your New Balance is less than or equal to your Monthly Minimum Payment, then your Monthly Minimum Payment will be equal to your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the Statement to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 23030, Columbus, GA 31902-3030. Any payment received in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If your payment is received in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. However, if your Payment Due Date occurs on a non-banking day, any payment received the next day which conforms to the above requirements will not be treated as late. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at a place other than the address in the immediately preceding paragraph, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your Account or any other credit account issued by us. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all of the full amount you owe without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds. Your available credit on your Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days."
531,7,"Application of Payments For each Billing Cycle, payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment will be allocated in any way we determine, including to balances with lower Annual Percentage Rates before balances with higher Annual Percentage Rates. We will generally apply payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law."
531,8,"Your interest charge for any Billing Cycle will include the following components, the total of which constitutes your total interest charge for the Billing Cycle: 1. A Cash Advance Transaction Fee imposed on each Cash Advance transaction posted during a Billing Cycle, in an amount equal to the greater of $5 or 5% of the amount of each Cash Advance. Any unpaid Cash Advance Transaction Fee will be added to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. We will not charge any Cash Advance Transaction Fees, however, during the one-year period beginning on the date you open your Account. 2. Periodic interest charge computed by applying the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate or Rates, determined as provided below under Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) to: a. your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances); and b. your Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases). However, if the total of the amounts so computed is an amount less than $.50, then a minimum interest charge of $.50 will be imposed instead of such smaller amounts. 3. A Foreign Currency Conversion Fee in an amount equal to 1% of the converted U.S. dollar amount of each transaction, including Cash Advances and Purchases, that is effected in any currency other than U.S. dollars."
531,9,"When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle. 2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. There is no grace period on Cash Advances and there is no period within which to pay to avoid interest charges on Cash Advances."
531,10,"Calculating the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Payment Fees, and Overlimit Fees. We add all other unpaid Fees to the Purchase balance on the day the fees are posted to your Account. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases. Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances."
531,11,"Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. The standard Purchase APR is 24.9% and the standard Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.075%. The standard Purchase APR and Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to Purchases unless the penalty APR and Monthly Periodic Rate apply, as described in the next paragraph. The APR and Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases will increase if we do not receive any Monthly Minimum Payment within 60 days of the date and time due. In such circumstance, the penalty APR and Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to your Purchases, including new Purchases and existing Purchase balances. The penalty Purchase APR is 29.9% and the penalty Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.4916%. If we receive six consecutive Monthly Minimum Payments when due after the increase to the penalty APR, then, starting with the next Billing Cycle, the penalty APR will no longer apply and the standard APR will apply to all Purchases. Otherwise, the penalty rate may continue to apply to your Account indefinitely. The Cash Advance APR is 29.9% and the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.4916%"
531,12,"n addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. Annual Fee We will charge an initial Annual Fee of $59 to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee of $59 on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice. Late Payment Fee If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Payment Fee to your Account. The Late Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Late Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Late Payment Fee is $40. The Late Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Minimum Interest Charge Fee If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $.50, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $.50 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion. Returned Payment Fee If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $40. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Overlimit Fee If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee is $29 if you were not charged an Overlimit Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Overlimit Fee is $40. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle. Documentation Fee You may request a copy of a Statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per Statement, which will be applied to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not impose any fee in connection with a good faith assertion of a billing error or other exercise of your Billing Rights (see below under “Your Billing Rights - Keep This Notice for Future Use”)."

Unless expressly made a part of this Agreement, and except as provided in the Arbitration of Disputes section below, any such benefits and services are not a part of this Agreement, and are subject only to the terms and conditions outlined in the benefits or services brochure and other official documents provided to you with respect to the benefits and services.

531,22,"Foreign Currency Conversion Payment must be made in U.S. Dollars for charges you incur in any other currency. If you effect a transaction with your Card in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard”) will convert the charge into a U.S. Dollar amount. Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date. We will also assess a Foreign Currency Conversion Fee interest charge as described in the “How Interest Charges are Determined” section. Honoring Your Card We are not responsible if anyone refuses to accept your Card or Account for any reason. Although you may have credit available, we may decline any transaction for any reason. We are not liable for any refusal to honor your Card or Account. From time to time, due to circumstances beyond our control (such as system failures, natural disasters, or other unpredictable events), our services may not be available. When this happens, you may be unable to use your Card or obtain information about your Account. We will not be responsible or liable if this happens."

531,24,"Arbitration of Disputes Provision PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS FS CARD SERVICES, INC. (“GENESIS”), ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. THIS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES OR A DEPENDENT OF SUCH MEMBER ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. PLEASE SEE THE SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT LABELED “MILITARY LENDING ACT.” IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT, YOU MAY CONTACT US AT 1-844-222-5695. This provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter what happens to your Account, including the closing of your Account. Except as expressly provided below, you must arbitrate individually, by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), any dispute or claim between you, any joint Cardholder and/or Authorized User, on the one hand, and us , our affiliates, and agents, and/or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises out of or is related to (a) this Agreement (including without limitation, any dispute over the validity of this Agreement to arbitrate disputes or of this entire Agreement), or (b) your Account, or (c) any relationship resulting from this Agreement, or (d) any insurance or other service related to your Account, or (e) any other agreement related to your Account (including prior agreements) or any such service, or (f) breach of this Agreement or any other such agreement, whether based on statute, contract, tort or any other legal theory (any “Claim”). However, we will not require you to arbitrate any individual Claims in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court. YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS, IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO GENESIS, ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT CARDHOLDER WITH YOU OR AN AUTHORIZED USER ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN “UNRELATED CARDHOLDER”), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS, ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CONSIDER SUCH CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS OR ANY SUCH CLAIMS YOU BRING ON BEHALF OF AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any dispute regarding whether a particular controversy is subject to arbitration, or the applicability or enforceability of the foregoing paragraph, will be decided by a court and not by an arbitrator. If you or we or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. The notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to Genesis FS Card Services, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Demand, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076, and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules in effect at the time an arbitration is commenced that are applicable to the resolution of consumer disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”). We will tell you how to contact the AAA and how to get a copy of the Arbitration Rules without cost if you ask us in writing to do so. The Arbitration Rules permit you to request deferral or reduction of the administrative fees of arbitration if paying them would cause you a hardship. In addition, if you ask us in writing, we will consider your request to pay any or all of your costs of arbitration. Each arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney who has been engaged in the private practice of law continuously during the ten years immediately preceding the arbitration or a retired judge of a court of general or appellate jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law, including attorneys’ fees if allowed by applicable law or agreement. All statutes of limitation, defenses, and attorney-client and other privileges that would apply in a court proceeding will apply in the arbitration. If any provision of this Section regarding arbitration of disputes shall be deemed to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Section shall be given full force and effect. However, if the provision precluding class, representative or private attorney general Claims in arbitration is deemed unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be void and of no force and effect. You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute or claim. Rejection will not affect any other aspect of the Agreement. To reject this Provision, you must send us a notice within sixty (60) days after you open your Account or we first provide you with a right to reject this Provision. This notice must include your name, address and Account Number and be mailed to Genesis FS Card Services, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076. This is the only way you can reject this Provision."
531,25,"This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your Statement, please write to us at: Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076-4499. In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and Account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Statement. • At least three (3) business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors, and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your Statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. F03-Y455-5 -0820 • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit."
531,26,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a Statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct. Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the Purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076-4499. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent."

In addition, any written application, acceptance certificate or other request you signed or otherwise submitted for this Account (the “Application”), your Card and the Card Carrier that we send with your Card, and your signature (including any electronic or digital signature) on any Application, sales slip or other evidence of indebtedness on your Account, are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement. This Agreement begins on the earlier of (i) the date you sign or otherwise submit an Application that is approved by us, or (ii) the first date that we extend credit to you on your Account, as evidenced by a signed sales slip or memorandum, a Cash Advance transaction, or otherwise. Definitions To simplify this Agreement for you, the definitions listed below will apply throughout, both in this Agreement and in your monthly Statements.

The words we, us, and our refer to First Electronic Bank. Account: The credit card account for which you were issued a Card imprinted with your Account number and that is subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

532,3,"Purchases and Cash Advances You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services from participating merchants. You may also use your Card to obtain Cash Advances from your Account at an ATM, or by presenting it to any institution that accepts the Card for that purpose. There are dollar limitations on individual Cash Advance transactions, and we may set a Cash Advance Limit for your Account. Please contact us for information about the Cash Advance limitations that apply to your Account. In addition, we may limit your Account to only one Cash Advance transaction per day. You promise to pay us and are liable for all amounts resulting from the authorized use of your Card or Account, plus any applicable interest charges and other applicable charges or fees, payable in U.S. dollars. This includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other documents for the transaction. If you use your Account number without presenting your actual Card, such as for mail, telephone, or internet purchases, this will be treated the same way as if you presented your Card. Your promise to pay us will apply to your estate if you die. We may limit and restrict the use of the Account/Card at our discretion. Such limitations and restrictions include, but are not limited to, gambling transactions, which include, but are not limited to, internet-related lottery tickets, casino gambling chips, off-track betting and wagers at racetracks. You remain responsible for use of your Account/Card in any such transactions. The Card may only be used for valid and lawful purposes. If you use, or you authorize someone else to use, the Card or Account for an unlawful or impermissible purpose, you will be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse us or Mastercard for any amounts or expenses we or they incur as a result of such use. The Card is and remains our property, and you will surrender it to us at any time upon request."
532,4,"Your Credit Limit You may not use your Account in any way that would cause you to go over your Credit Limit. We may refuse to authorize or accept any transaction on your Account that would cause you to exceed your Credit Limit, even if you have authorized us to charge you an Overlimit Fee for doing so. We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit; however, in that case you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit. We may at any time and without prior notice to you increase or decrease your Credit Limit, limit the Credit Limit for Cash Advances or take away your ability to obtain Cash Advances. MAKING PAYMENTS Monthly Statements We will send a Statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution."
532,5,"Monthly Minimum Payment The Monthly Minimum Payment is 7% of your New Balance or $40, whichever is greater. If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must pay at least the Monthly Minimum Payment by the Payment Due Date shown on your Statement, which is at least 25 days after the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle. Your Monthly Minimum Payment also will include any past due amount or any amount by which the New Balance exceeds your Credit Limit, whichever is greater. If your New Balance is less than or equal to your Monthly Minimum Payment, then your Monthly Minimum Payment will be equal to your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the Statement to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 23030, Columbus, GA 31902-3030. Any payment received in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If your payment is received in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M., Eastern Time, on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. However, if your Payment Due Date occurs on a non-banking day, any payment received the next day which conforms to the above requirements will not be treated as late. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments received by us at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at a place other than the address in the immediately preceding paragraph, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. We do not accept cash payments through the mail. You may not make payments with funds from your Account or any other credit account issued by us. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all of the full amount you owe without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds. Your available credit on your Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days. Application of Payments For each Billing Cycle, payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment will be allocated in any way we determine, including to balances with lower Annual Percentage Rates before balances with higher Annual Percentage Rates. We will generally apply payments up to the amount of your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law."
532,6,"HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your interest charge for any Billing Cycle will include the following components, the total of which constitutes your total interest charge for the Billing Cycle: 1. A Cash Advance Transaction Fee imposed on each Cash Advance transaction posted during a Billing Cycle, in an amount equal to the greater of $5 or 5% of the amount of each Cash Advance. Any unpaid Cash Advance Transaction Fee will be added to the calculation of your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. We will not charge any Cash Advance Transaction Fees, however, during the one-year period beginning on the date you open your Account. 2. Periodic interest charge computed by applying the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate or Rates, determined as provided below under Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) to: a. your Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances); and b. your Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases). However, if the total of the amounts so computed is an amount less than $.50, then a minimum interest charge Fee of $.50 will be imposed instead of such smaller amounts. 3. A Foreign Currency Conversion Fee in an amount equal to 1% of the converted U.S. dollar amount of each transaction, including Cash Advances and Purchases, that is effected in any currency other than U.S. dollars. When Interest Charges Begin to Accrue Interest charges on Purchases will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Purchase is made, and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. However, we do not assess interest charges in the following circumstances: 1. If you paid the New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date during the previous Billing Cycle, or if that New Balance was $0 or a credit balance, then: a. if you pay the New Balance on your current Statement in full by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will not assess interest charges on Purchases during your current Billing Cycle; and b. if you make a payment that is less than the New Balance by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle, we will credit that payment as of the first day in your current Billing Cycle. 2. If you had a New Balance at the beginning of your previous Billing Cycle and you did not pay that New Balance by the Payment Due Date during that previous Billing Cycle, then we will not assess interest charges on any Purchases during the current Billing Cycle if you pay the New Balance at the beginning of your current Billing Cycle by the Payment Due Date in your current Billing Cycle. Periodic interest charges on Cash Advances will be imposed at the applicable Monthly Periodic Rate from the date each Cash Advance is made and will continue to accrue on unpaid balances as long as they remain unpaid. There is no grace period on Cash Advances and there is no period within which to pay to avoid interest charges on Cash Advances."
532,7,"Calculating the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Subject to Interest Charges Average Daily Balance of Purchases (including new Purchases): To get the Average Daily Balance of Purchases, we take the beginning Purchase balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Purchases and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Purchases, add any new Purchases as of the date of transaction, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. On the first day of a Billing Cycle, we also add any unpaid Late Payment Fees, and Overlimit Fees. We add all other unpaid Fees to the Purchase balance on the day the fees are posted to your Account. This gives us the daily balance for Purchases. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Purchases. Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances (including new Cash Advances): To get the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances, we take the beginning Cash Advance balance of your Account each day, including unpaid interest charges on Cash Advances and Foreign Currency Conversion Fees on Cash Advances, add any new Cash Advances as of the date of transaction, add the Cash Advance Transaction Fee on any Cash Advances as of the transaction date of each Cash Advance, and subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits as of the transaction date. This gives us the daily balance for Cash Advances. Then we add all these daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the Average Daily Balance of Cash Advances. Computing the Purchase and Cash Advance Balance Monthly Periodic Rates and Corresponding Annual Percentage Rates (APR) Monthly Periodic Rates The Monthly Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 12. The standard Purchase APR is 24.9% and the standard Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.075%. The standard Purchase APR and Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to Purchases unless the penalty APR and Monthly Periodic Rate apply, as described in the next paragraph. The APR and Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases will increase if we do not receive any Monthly Minimum Payment within 60 days of the date and time due. In such circumstance, the penalty APR and Monthly Periodic Rate will apply to your Purchases, including new Purchases and existing Purchase balances. The penalty Purchase APR is 29.9% and the penalty Monthly Periodic Rate for Purchases is 2.4916%. If we receive six consecutive Monthly Minimum Payments when due after the increase to the penalty APR, then, starting with the next Billing Cycle, the penalty APR will no longer apply and the standard APR will apply to all Purchases. Otherwise, the penalty rate may continue to apply to your Account indefinitely. The Cash Advance APR is 29.9% and the Monthly Periodic Rate for Cash Advances is 2.4916%"
532,8,"OTHER FEES In addition to interest charges, a variety of fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. Annual Fee We will charge an initial Annual Fee of $75 to your Account on or about the date your Account is opened and then a renewal Annual Fee of $99 on or about each anniversary of that date. The initial Annual Fee is nonrefundable; the renewal Annual Fee is also nonrefundable unless you notify us to cancel your Account within 30 days from the mailing date of the billing Statement or other communication containing the renewal Annual Fee notice. Late Payment Fee If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will charge a Late Payment Fee to your Account. The Late Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Late Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Late Payment Fee is $40. The Late Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Minimum Interest Charge Fee If the periodic interest charge amounts computed in the How Interest Charges Are Determined section are an amount less than $.50, then a Minimum Interest Charge Fee of $.50 will be charged instead of such smaller amounts and will be treated as a fee on your billing statement and added to your Purchases at our discretion. Returned Payment Fee If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will charge a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $29 if you were not charged a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $40. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment. Overlimit Fee If you elected to have overlimit coverage, we may charge an Overlimit Fee when a transaction causes you to go over or remain over your Credit Limit during any Billing Cycle. We may also charge you two additional Overlimit Fees if your New Balance remains over your Credit Limit as of the Payment Due Date in future Billing Cycles. We will only charge you one Overlimit Fee per Billing Cycle, even if you go over your Credit Limit multiple times in the same Billing Cycle. The Overlimit Fee is $29 if you were not charged an Overlimit Fee during any of the prior six Billing Cycles. Otherwise, the Overlimit Fee is $40. The Overlimit Fee will never exceed the maximum amount you are over your Credit Limit during the Billing Cycle. Documentation Fee You may request a copy of a Statement previously sent to you for a Documentation Fee of $3 per Statement, which will be applied to your Account. Copies of sales tickets or other items posted to your Account may be obtained for a Documentation Fee of $10 per sales ticket or other item, which will be applied to your Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not impose any fee in connection with a good faith assertion of a billing error or other exercise of your Billing Rights (see below under “Your Billing Rights - Keep This Notice for Future Use”)."

532,12,"OUR RIGHTS AND HOW THEY AFFECT YOU Merchant Refunds If a merchant agrees to give you a refund for goods or services purchased with your Card or Account, you will accept a credit on your Account instead of a cash refund. We do not control when a merchant sends us your refund and we will have a reasonable amount of time after we receive your refund to process it. No Waiver of Rights; Disputed Amounts We can accept late or partial payments without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. You agree not to send us partial payments marked “paid in full,” “without recourse,” or similar language. If you send such a payment, we may accept it without losing any of our rights under this Agreement. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicated that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount, must be mailed or delivered to Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, Oregon 97076. Credit Reports and Information You authorize us to make or have made any credit, employment, or other investigative inquiries we deem appropriate to extend you credit or collect amounts owed to us on your Account. We (including any assignee of the Account or amounts owing under the Account) may also obtain information about you from credit reporting agencies or others at any time and use it for the purposes of monitoring your credit performance, managing your Account and considering you for new offers and programs. Notice of Inaccurate Information If you believe that we have information about you that is inaccurate or that we have reported or may report to a credit reporting agency information about you that is inaccurate, please notify us of the specific information that you believe is inaccurate by writing to us at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076"
532,13,"Default and Collection Unless prohibited by applicable law, your Account is considered to be in default if (1) you fail to make the required Monthly Minimum Payment on or before the Payment Due Date, including if your payment is returned or cannot be processed and you do not correct that failure within 31 days, (2) you try to exceed or do exceed your Credit Limit without permission and do not bring your Account back under your Credit Limit within 31 days, (3) you become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, (4) you become subject to attachment or garnishment proceedings, (5) you give us any false information or signature, (6) you die, or (7) you fail to comply with any portion of this Agreement. Our accepting a late or partial payment does not waive default. Default on this Account will constitute default on all accounts you hold with us. Subject to any notice of default and right to cure or other restrictions of applicable law, if you are in default, we may declare the entire balance due immediately. You agree to pay our reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees and expenses related to the collection of your Account, and retrieving your Card, to the extent permitted by applicable laws. Change of Terms Subject to the limitations of applicable law, we may, at any time, change or remove any of the terms and conditions of, or add new terms or conditions to, this Agreement. If required by applicable law, we will mail written notice of such a change to you in the manner required by such law. As of the effective date, the changed or new terms will apply to new Purchases and Cash Advances and also to the outstanding balance of your Account, subject to the limitations of applicable law. Delay in Enforcement We can delay enforcing our rights under this Agreement without losing them."
532,14,"OTHER PROVISIONS Ownership and Use of Your Card As the Cardholder(s), you are liable for all credit obtained under your Account. If you or an Authorized User authorizes another person to use your Card, you are liable for any credit obtained on your Account for as long as that person holds the Card. In addition, you will remain liable until you recover possession of the Card. Misuse of your Card by an authorized person will not be considered unauthorized use. See “Lost Cards and Unauthorized Use” above. Upon demand, you must immediately return any Card we supply to you or destroy the Card by cutting it in half. Authorized Users If you ask us to issue a Card to any other person and we agree, they are an Authorized User. We may require certain information about an Authorized User. We may also discuss your Account with an Authorized User and provide them with Account information. You will be responsible for the Authorized User’s use of the Card and Account as well as anyone else they allow to use your Card or Account. This will be true even if you did not want, or agree to, the use. Removing an Authorized User If you want to remove an Authorized User from your Account, you must contact us and request their removal. We will have a reasonable amount of time after we receive your request to remove them. You also must immediately destroy all Cards in their possession and cancel all of their billing arrangements to the Account. We will not do this for you. During this time, you still will be responsible for all amounts they, or another person they authorize to use the Card, charge to the Account. You will be responsible even if these amounts do not appear on your Account until later. An Authorized User may remove themselves from the Account upon their request. We reserve the right to remove them from your Account for any reason. To remove them from your Account, we may close your existing Account and issue a new Card with a new Account number. Transactions You will retain for Statement verification your copy of each Purchase slip, Cash Advance or other transaction to your Account."
532,15,"Transfer of Your Account You may not transfer your Account to any other person. We may assign your Account or amounts owing under your Account to any other person at any time and the assignee will take our place under the Agreement with respect to all agreements and interests transferred. You must pay the assignee and otherwise perform your obligations under the assigned agreements and interests. Closing or Suspending Your Account We may close or suspend your Account or your ability to obtain credit on your Account, or both, at any time, for any reason permitted by law and with or without advance notice. You may close your Account at any time by contacting us. The closure of Account will not become effective until you have returned to us all of the Cards we have given you. If you have a joint Account and want to remove one of the names from the Account, we must receive a written request signed by both of the Cardholders on the Account and all Cards must be returned upon request. No party is released from the obligation for the balance owing on a joint Account, unless we agree to the arrangements in writing. You may have to reapply for a new Card for an individual Account when you request a change from a joint Account to an individual Account. If your Account is closed or suspended for any reason, you must stop using your Card. You must also cancel all billing arrangements to the Account. We will not do this for you. If we close or permanently suspend your Account, you must also return all Cards to us. You must still pay us all amounts you owe on the Account, even if they are charged after your Account is closed or suspended. Additional Benefits and Services From time to time, we may offer you benefits and services with your Account. These benefits and services may be provided by us or third parties. Unless expressly made a part of this Agreement, and except as provided in the Arbitration of Disputes section below, any such benefits and services are not a part of this Agreement, and are subject only to the terms and conditions outlined in the benefits or services brochure and other official documents provided to you with respect to the benefits and services.

Except as required by applicable law, we are not liable for benefits or services provided by third parties or the actions or omissions of those third parties."
532,16,"Foreign Currency Conversion Payment must be made in U.S. Dollars for charges you incur in any other currency. If you effect a transaction with your Card in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard”) will convert the charge into a U.S. Dollar amount. Mastercard will act in accordance with its operating regulations or conversion procedures in effect at the time that the transaction is processed. Currently, the currency conversion rate used by Mastercard to determine the transaction amount in U.S. Dollars for such transactions is generally either a government mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. The currency conversion rate used by Mastercard on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the Purchase date or monthly Statement posting date. We will also assess a Foreign Currency Conversion Fee interest charge as described in the “How Interest Charges are Determined” section. Honoring Your Card We are not responsible if anyone refuses to accept your Card or Account for any reason. Although you may have credit available, we may decline any transaction for any reason. We are not liable for any refusal to honor your Card or Account. From time to time, due to circumstances beyond our control (such as system failures, natural disasters, or other unpredictable events), our services may not be available. When this happens, you may be unable to use your Card or obtain information about your Account. We will not be responsible or liable if this happens. Change of Address, Employment and Telephone We will send all written notices and Statements to your address as it appears on our records. To avoid delays and missed payments that could affect your credit standing, you agree to promptly advise us if you change your mailing address, place of employment, or telephone number. Severability In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.

The headings used in this Agreement are for the convenience of reference only and are not intended to define or describe the scope or intent of any portion of the Agreement. Governing Law Except as expressly set forth in the Arbitration of Disputes section, this Agreement and the interpretation and enforcement thereof (including but not limited to the exportation of interest rates) will be governed by Federal law that applies to us, and to the extent not preempted by Federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions and principles. If there is any conflict between any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and applicable Federal or State law, this Agreement will be considered changed to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable law."
532,17,"Arbitration of Disputes Provision PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU SEND US THE REJECTION NOTICE DESCRIBED BELOW, THIS PROVISION WILL APPLY TO YOUR ACCOUNT, AND MOST DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS FS CARD SERVICES, INC. (“GENESIS”), ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL BE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS MEANS THAT: (1) NEITHER A COURT NOR A JURY WILL RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; (2) YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING; (3) LESS INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE; AND (4) APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED. THIS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU IF, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES OR A DEPENDENT OF SUCH MEMBER ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT. PLEASE SEE THE SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT LABELED “MILITARY LENDING ACT.” IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY LENDING ACT, YOU MAY CONTACT US AT 1-844-222-5695. This provision replaces any existing arbitration provision with us and will stay in force no matter what happens to your Account, including the closing of your Account. Except as expressly provided below, you must arbitrate individually, by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), any dispute or claim between you, any joint Cardholder and/or Authorized User, on the one hand, and us , our affiliates, and agents, and/or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, on the other hand, if the dispute or claim arises out of or is related to (a) this Agreement (including without limitation, any dispute over the validity of this Agreement to arbitrate disputes or of this entire Agreement), or (b) your Account, or (c) any relationship resulting from this Agreement, or (d) any insurance or other service related to your Account, or (e) any other agreement related to your Account (including prior agreements) or any such service, or (f) breach of this Agreement or any other such agreement, whether based on statute, contract, tort or any other legal theory (any “Claim”). However, we will not require you to arbitrate any individual Claims in small claims court or your state’s equivalent court, so long as it remains an individual case in that court. YOU AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO GENESIS, IN COURT OR ARBITRATION. ALSO, YOU MAY NOT BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS, ON BEHALF OF ANY CARDHOLDER WHO IS NOT A JOINT CARDHOLDER WITH YOU OR AN AUTHORIZED USER ON YOUR ACCOUNT (AN “UNRELATED CARDHOLDER”), AND YOU AGREE THAT NO UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS AGAINST US OR ANY SERVICER OF YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GENESIS, ON YOUR BEHALF. CLAIMS BY YOU AND AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER MAY NOT BE JOINED IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE POWER TO CONSIDER SUCH CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS OR ANY SUCH CLAIMS YOU BRING ON BEHALF OF AN UNRELATED CARDHOLDER. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any dispute regarding whether a particular controversy is subject to arbitration, or the applicability or enforceability of the foregoing paragraph, will be decided by a court and not by an arbitrator. If you or we or any servicer of your Account, including, but not limited to, Genesis, elect to arbitrate a claim, the electing party must notify the other party in writing. The notice can be given after the beginning of a lawsuit and can be given in papers filed in the lawsuit. Otherwise, your notice must be sent to Genesis FS Card Services, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Demand, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076, and our notice must be sent to the most recent address for you in our files. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its rules in effect at the time an arbitration is commenced that are applicable to the resolution of consumer disputes (the “Arbitration Rules”). We will tell you how to contact the AAA and how to get a copy of the Arbitration Rules without cost if you ask us in writing to do so. The Arbitration Rules permit you to request deferral or reduction of the administrative fees of arbitration if paying them would cause you a hardship. In addition, if you ask us in writing, we will consider your request to pay any or all of your costs of arbitration. Each arbitrator shall be a licensed attorney who has been engaged in the private practice of law continuously during the ten years immediately preceding the arbitration or a retired judge of a court of general or appellate jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall award only such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could properly award under applicable law, including attorneys’ fees if allowed by applicable law or agreement. All statutes of limitation, defenses, and attorney-client and other privileges that would apply in a court proceeding will apply in the arbitration. If any provision of this Section regarding arbitration of disputes shall be deemed to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Section shall be given full force and effect. However, if the provision precluding class, representative or private attorney general Claims in arbitration is deemed unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be void and of no force and effect. You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any dispute or claim. Rejection will not affect any other aspect of the Agreement. To reject this Provision, you must send us a notice within sixty (60) days after you open your Account or we first provide you with a right to reject this Provision. This notice must include your name, address and Account Number and be mailed to Genesis FS Card Services, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, P.O. Box 4477, Beaverton, Oregon 97076. This is the only way you can reject this Provision."

What To Do If You Think You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your Statement, please write to us at: Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076-4499. In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and Account number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on your Statement. • At least three (3) business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong. You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors, and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1. Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error. 2. Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct. While we investigate whether or not there has been an error: • We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount. • The charge in question may remain on your Statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. • While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance. • We can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit."
532,19,"After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen: • If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount. • If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will then send you a Statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question, even if your bill is correct. Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the Purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1. The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2. You must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at Genesis FS Card Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076-4499. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent."

You promise to pay us and are liable for all amounts resulting from the authorized use of your Account Number or Account, plus any applicable interest charges and other applicable charges or fees, payable in U.S. dollars. Your Credit Limit. You may not use your Account in any way that would cause you to go over your Credit Limit. We may refuse to authorize or accept any transaction on your Account if (1) that transaction would cause you to exceed your Credit Limit or (2) your Account is delinquent. We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit. If we do so, in that case, you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit."
533,9,"MAKING PAYMENTS Monthly Statements. We will send a statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your Account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Monthly Minimum Payment. Your Monthly Minimum Payment due will be the greater of: 1. $15; or 2. The sum of: a. Each fixed monthly payment amount applicable to each of your Purchases (described below), plus b. 5% of your Regular Balance. Each Purchase will have a fixed monthly payment amount which we calculate when the Purchase is posted to your Account. We determine the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase by multiplying the Purchase amount by 5%, and then rounding the result to the nearest dollar. If the remaining balance of a Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is less than the fixed monthly payment amount, we will reduce the fixed monthly payment amount for that Purchase accordingly. We will continue to include the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase in the Monthly Minimum Payment due until the Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is paid in full. If you make a payment in excess of the Monthly Minimum Payment due for any month, it will not reduce the fixed monthly payment amount applicable to any Purchase that is used to calculate your Monthly Minimum Payment due in subsequent months, but it may result in your paying off a Purchase more quickly. Your Monthly Minimum Payment due also will include the greater of (i) any past due amount, or (ii) any amount by which the New Balance exceeded your Credit Limit. Your Monthly Minimum Payment due will never exceed your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the monthly statement to Genesis FS Card Services, PO Box 84049 Columbus, GA 31908-4049. Any payment we receive in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If we receive your payment in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day, or any time on a nonbanking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments we receive at any other location or in any other form may not be"
533,10,"credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at some other place, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all you owe on your Account without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds, and your total Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days. Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, we will allocate payment amounts up to your Monthly Minimum Payment to charges and principal due (including new transactions) in any way we determine. We will generally apply payment amounts up to your Monthly Minimum Payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your Monthly Minimum Payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law."
533,11,"HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your Interest Rate. We use a daily periodic rate to calculate the interest on your Account. The daily periodic rate is the applicable APR multiplied by 1/365. The daily periodic rate for your Account is 0.0956% and the applicable APR is 34.9%. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest on your Purchases from the date you make the Purchase until you pay the Purchase in full. How We Calculate Interest. We calculate interest separately for each balance segment on your Account. We do this by applying the daily periodic rate to your average daily balance (including new Purchases), and then multiplying the resulting number by the number of days in the Billing Cycle for each balance segment. An average daily balance is calculated for the following balance segments as applicable: Purchase Balance segments and the Regular Balance segment."
533,12,"We calculate interest for each balance segment as follows: 1. For each day, we take the beginning balance of each balance segment in the Billing Cycle, including any unpaid interest charges, add any new Purchases and debits, and then subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits. This gives us the daily balance. Late Payment Fees, Returned Payment Fees, and Documentation Fees are not included in the daily balance. 2. Then, we add all the daily balances for the Billing Cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 3. Next, we multiply the daily periodic rate by the average daily balance. 4. Finally, we take the resulting number from #3 and multiply it by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. This gives us the interest charge for each balance segment for the Billing Cycle."
533,13,"OTHER FEES 1676-3 In addition to interest charges, other fees may be applied to your Account, as set forth below. The amounts of these fees may change from time to time during the term of your Account. Late Payment Fee. If we do not receive your Monthly Minimum Payment due by the Closing Date of the Billing Cycle in which the Payment Due Date occurs and the amount past due on your Account is more than $9.99, we will apply a Late Payment Fee to your Account. The Late Payment Fee is $27 if we did not charge a Late Payment Fee during any of the prior six billing periods. Otherwise, the Late Payment Fee is $38. The Late Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recently required Monthly Minimum Payment"
533,14,"Returned Payment Fee. If any payment on your Account is returned to us unpaid for any reason, we will apply a Returned Payment Fee to your Account. The Returned Payment Fee is $27 if we did not charge a Returned Payment Fee during any of the prior six billing periods. Otherwise, the Returned Payment Fee is $38. The Returned Payment Fee will never exceed the Monthly Minimum Payment. Documentation Fee.

Billing Cycle: The time interval covered by a monthly statement. Each Billing Cycle is approximately 30 days in length.

We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit. If we do so, in that case, you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit."
534,4,"MAKING PAYMENTS Monthly Statements. We will send a statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your Account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Monthly Minimum Payment. Your monthly minimum payment due will be the greater of: 1. $15; or 2. The sum of: a. Each fixed monthly payment amount applicable to each of your Purchases (described below), plus b. 5% of your Regular Balance. Each Purchase will have a fixed monthly payment amount which we calculate when the Purchase is posted to your Account. We determine the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase by multiplying the Purchase amount by 5%, and then rounding the result to"
534,5,"the nearest dollar. If the remaining balance of a Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is less than the fixed monthly payment amount, we will reduce the fixed monthly payment amount for that Purchase accordingly. We will continue to include the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase in the monthly minimum payment due until the Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is paid in full. If you make a payment in excess of the monthly minimum payment due for any month, it will not reduce the fixed monthly payment amount applicable to any Purchase that is used to calculate your monthly minimum payment due in subsequent months, but it may result in your paying off a Purchase more quickly. Your monthly minimum payment due also will include the greater of (i) any past due amount, or (ii) any amount by which the New Balance exceeded your Credit Limit. Your monthly minimum payment due will never exceed your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the monthly statement to Bankcard Services, P.O. Box 84049, Columbus, Georgia 31908. Any payment we receive in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If we receive your payment in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments we receive at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at some other place, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all you owe on your Account without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds, and your total Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days. Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, we will allocate payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment to charges and principal due (including new transactions) in any way we determine. We will generally apply payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your monthly minimum payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law. During the last two Billing Cycles of a deferred interest period, if you have an outstanding deferred interest balance, we will apply these excess amounts to the deferred interest promotion balance"
534,6,"DEFERRED INTEREST Each Purchase on your Account is subject to up to 6 months of deferred interest, beginning on the date of the Purchase (the “deferred interest period”). Interest will be charged to your Account from the date of the Purchase if the Purchase balance is not paid in full within the deferred interest period or if you make a late payment. Each Purchase transaction accrues interest from the Date of the Purchase, but we will not charge that interest to your Account if you pay that Purchase balance in full before the end of the deferred interest period and you make monthly minimum payments as required. The deferred interest period will end when one or more of the following events occur: • 6 months from the Purchase date; • Your Account becomes more than 180 days past due; • Your Account is charged off for any reason. Interest on each Purchase transaction will accrue during the deferred interest period at 34.9% APR. You must make monthly minimum payments during the deferred interest period. The monthly statement we send you will include these monthly minimum payment amounts and will help you keep track of your Purchase balance(s) and their deferred interest period(s). Paying only the monthly minimum payment may not pay off the Purchase balance within the deferred interest period. You may have to make additional or increased payments during the deferred interest period to avoid having to pay all accrued deferred interest. After the deferred interest period, interest will be charged at 34.9% APR"
534,7,HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your Interest Rate. We use a daily periodic rate to calculate the interest on your account. The daily periodic rate is the applicable APR multiplied by 1/365. The daily periodic rate for your account is 0.0956% and the applicable APR is 34.9%. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest on your Purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full.
534,8,"How We Calculate Interest. We calculate interest separately for each balance segment on your Account. We do this by applying the daily periodic rate to your average daily balance (including new Purchases), and then multiplying the resulting number by the number of days in the Billing Cycle for each balance segment. An average daily balance is calculated for the following balance segments as applicable: Purchase Balance segments and the Regular Balance segment. We calculate interest for each balance segment as follows: 1. For each day, we take the beginning balance of each balance segment in the billing cycle, including any unpaid interest charges, add any new purchases and debits, and then subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits. This gives us the daily balance. Late Payment Fees, Returned Payment Fees, and Documentation Fees are not included in the daily balance. 2. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 3. Next, we multiply the daily periodic rate by the average daily balance. 4. Finally, we take the resulting number from #3 and multiply it by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the interest charge for each balance segment for the billing cycle."

In your letter, give us the following information: • Account information: Your name and Account Number. • Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error. • Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake. You must contact us: • Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement. • At least three (3) business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.

We will then send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.

The Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50.

You must have used your Account for the Purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your Account do not qualify. 3. You must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at: Bankcard Services, P.O. Box 4499, Beaverton, OR 97076. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision.

We may temporarily agree to allow you to exceed your Credit Limit. If we do so, in that case, you must repay the excess amount according to the terms of this Agreement. Any transactions honored in excess of your Credit Limit will not result in an increase of your Credit Limit"
535,4,"MAKING PAYMENTS Monthly Statements. We will send a statement at the end of each monthly Billing Cycle if there is a debit or credit balance on your Account of $1 or more, a balance on which an interest charge has been imposed or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to pay us, or any party to whom we may transfer and assign your Account or the amounts owing under your Account, in U.S. dollars according to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. Payments made by a check, money order or other negotiable instrument must be in a form acceptable to us and drawn on a U.S. financial institution. Monthly Minimum Payment. Your monthly minimum payment due will be the greater of: 1. $15; or 2. The sum of: a. Each fixed monthly payment amount applicable to each of your Purchases (described below), plus b. 5% of your Regular Balance. Each Purchase will have a fixed monthly payment amount which we calculate when the Purchase is posted to your Account. We determine the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase by multiplying the Purchase amount by 5%, and then rounding the result to"
535,5,"the nearest dollar. If the remaining balance of a Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is less than the fixed monthly payment amount, we will reduce the fixed monthly payment amount for that Purchase accordingly. We will continue to include the fixed monthly payment amount for a Purchase in the monthly minimum payment due until the Purchase plus accrued interest on that Purchase is paid in full. If you make a payment in excess of the monthly minimum payment due for any month, it will not reduce the fixed monthly payment amount applicable to any Purchase that is used to calculate your monthly minimum payment due in subsequent months, but it may result in your paying off a Purchase more quickly. Your monthly minimum payment due also will include the greater of (i) any past due amount, or (ii) any amount by which the New Balance exceeded your Credit Limit. Your monthly minimum payment due will never exceed your New Balance. Payments should be mailed with the payment coupon and in the envelope provided and following the other instructions on the monthly statement to Bankcard Services, P.O. Box 84049, Columbus, Georgia 31908. Any payment we receive in that form and at that address on or before 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day will be credited to your Account that day. If we receive your payment in that form and at that address after 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on a normal banking day, or any time on a non-banking day, we will credit it to your Account the next banking day. Please allow at least seven (7) business days for postal delivery. Payments we receive at any other location or in any other form may not be credited as of the day we receive them. If we accept a payment at some other place, we may delay the crediting of the payment for up to five (5) days. This may cause you to incur Late Payment Fees and additional interest charges, and may result in your Account being declared in default. When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction. When we use information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment and you will not receive your check back from your financial institution. At any time, you may pay part or all you owe on your Account without incurring any additional charge for prepayment. The amount of any payment that exceeds your total New Balance will be applied as a credit to your Account, and any remaining credit balance will be refunded as required by law. Credit availability may be delayed at our sole discretion to ensure payment in good funds, and your total Credit Limit may not reflect your payments for up to 14 days."
535,6,"Application of Payments. For each Billing Cycle, we will allocate payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment to charges and principal due (including new transactions) in any way we determine. We will generally apply payment amounts up to your monthly minimum payment in a manner most favorable or convenient for us. For each Billing Cycle, to the extent your payments exceed your monthly minimum payment, we will apply these excess amounts in the order required by applicable law. During the last two Billing Cycles of a deferred interest period, if you have an outstanding deferred interest balance, we will apply these excess amounts to the deferred interest promotion balance. DEFERRED INTEREST Each Purchase on your Account is subject to up to 12 months of deferred interest, beginning on the date of the Purchase (the “deferred interest period”). Interest will be charged to your Account from the date of the Purchase if the Purchase balance is not paid in full within the deferred interest period or if you make a late payment. Each Purchase transaction accrues interest from the Date of the Purchase, but we will not charge that interest to your Account if you pay that Purchase balance in full before the end of the deferred interest period and you make monthly minimum payments as required. The deferred interest period will end when one or more of the following events occur: • 12 months from the Purchase date; • Your Account becomes more than 180 days past due; • Your Account is charged off for any reason. Interest on each Purchase transaction will accrue during the deferred interest period at 34.9% APR. You must make monthly minimum payments during the deferred interest period. The monthly statement we send you will include these monthly minimum payment amounts and will help you keep track of your Purchase balance(s) and their deferred interest period(s). Paying only the monthly minimum payment may not pay off the Purchase balance within the deferred interest period. You may have to make additional or increased payments during the deferred interest period to avoid having to pay all accrued deferred interest. After the deferred interest period, interest will be charged at 34.9% APR"
535,7,"HOW INTEREST CHARGES ARE DETERMINED Your Interest Rate. We use a daily periodic rate to calculate the interest on your account. The daily periodic rate is the applicable APR multiplied by 1/365. The daily periodic rate for your account is 0.0956% and the applicable APR is 34.9%. When We Charge Interest. We charge interest on your Purchases from the date you make the purchase until you pay the purchase in full. 0000000000238059 000066 0003 0005 0 1 0 0 0 2oz - #10 - 66 - 197 Page 2 of 3 FEB 1678 V2 How We Calculate Interest. We calculate interest separately for each balance segment on your Account. We do this by applying the daily periodic rate to your average daily balance (including new Purchases), and then multiplying the resulting number by the number of days in the Billing Cycle for each balance segment. An average daily balance is calculated for the following balance segments as applicable: Purchase Balance segments and the Regular Balance segment. We calculate interest for each balance segment as follows: 1. For each day, we take the beginning balance of each balance segment in the billing cycle, including any unpaid interest charges, add any new purchases and debits, and then subtract the applicable portion of any payments and credits. This gives us the daily balance. Late Payment Fees, Returned Payment Fees, and Documentation Fees are not included in the daily balance. 2. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the average daily balance. 3. Next, we multiply the daily periodic rate by the average daily balance. 4. Finally, we take the resulting number from #3 and multiply it by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the interest charge for each balance segment for the billing cycle."
